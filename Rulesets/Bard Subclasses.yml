   - - College of Creation Abilities:
       - Note of Potential: When you join the College of Creation at 3rd level, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which 
                            orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another 
                            symbol of art or life that you choose. When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack roll, or 
                            a saving throw, as detailed below;
                            - Ability Check: When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops
                                             and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.
                            - Attack Roll: Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice
                                           that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration 
                                           die.
                            - Saving Throw: Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary 
                                            hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
       - Performance of Creation: as an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in
                                  a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly 
                                  hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can create, see the equipment chapter of the Player's 
                                  Handbook. Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use this feature again. You can 
                                  have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes. The size of the item you can create 
                                  with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).
       - Animating Performance: as an action, you can target a Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency 
                                bonus (PB), The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die. In combat, the item shares your 
                                initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus 
                                action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not 
                                just Dodge. When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration. Once you animate an item with this feature, you 
                                can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if 
                                you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.                      
                                - Dancing Item:
                                Large or smaller construct

                                the turn, provided the item isn't incapacitated.

       - Creative Crescendo: when you use your Performance of Creation feature, you can create more than one item at once. The number of items equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of two items). If you create an item that 
                             would exceed that number, you choose which of the previously created items disappears. Only one of these items can be of the maximum size you can create; the rest must be Small or Tiny. You are no 
                             longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.

                                     favor, giving you advantage on all charisma checks against them for the next 24 hours. On a Success, that creature is immune to this abaility for the next 24 hours
                                     
                                     
                                     
   - - College of Glamour Abilities:
       - Mantle of Inspiration: As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures you can see and who can see you within 60
                                feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its 
                                reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 
                                10th level, and 14 at 15th level.   
       - Enthralling Performance: If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids 
                                  within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell
                                  save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who speaks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, avoiding violence
                                  unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of
                                  its allies. If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it. 
       - Mantle of Majesty: you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast Command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of 
                            unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast Command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without 
                            expending a spell slot. Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
                            finish a long rest.
       - Unbreakable Majesty: your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce. In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or 
                              until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On 
                              a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage
                              on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn. Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

       - Bonus Proficiencies: you gain proficiency with three Skills of your choice.
       - Cutting Words: you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an Attack roll, an ability check,
                        or a damage roll, you can use your Reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to
                        use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the Attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune
                        if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being Charmed.
       - Additional Magic Secrets: you learn two Spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen Spells count as Bard Spells for you 
                                   but don’t count against the number of Bard Spells you know.
       - Peerless Skill: when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die
                         for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.
                         
                         
                         
   - - College of Eloquence Abilities:

       - Unsettling Words: you can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see
                           within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn
       - Unfailing Inspiration: your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll
                                fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die 
       - Universal Speech: you have gained the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 
                           of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, 
                           unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.
       - Infectious Inspiration: when you successfully inspire someone, the power of your eloquence can now spread to someone else. When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability 
                                 check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can use your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a 
                                 Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all 
                                 expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                                 
                                 
                                 
   - - College of Ink Abilities:
       - Bonus Proficiencies: you gain proficiency with Tattooist’s Supplies and Calligrapher’s Supplies
       - Connoisseur of Symbols: you have advantage on any ability check that you make using Arcana, History, Nature, Religion or your Tattooist’s Supplies or Calligrapher’s Supplies proficiencies to determine the nature of a
                                 tattoo, sigil, or symbol. This includes symbols using a language you do not understand, so long as the symbol is mostly comprised of other shapes and images. This allows you to identify magic
                                 tattoos with a successful check as well as understand basic warnings and information communicated through markings
       - Lasting Inspiration: you can imbue your Bardic Inspiration into a tattoo. When you are tattooing someone, you may expend all remaining uses of your Bardic Inspiration to imbue one Bardic Inspiration die into the tattoo.
                              The tattoo receives your current Bardic Inspiration die and does not increase when you increase in level. Once the tattoo is complete, the bearer may use a bonus action to activate the tattoo, adding
                              your Bardic Inspiration die to their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once the recipient has used the tattoo in this fashion, it cannot be used again until they complete a long rest.
                              You may add Lasting Inspiration to any tattoo you craft, be it magical or not. Adding Lasting Inspiration to a magical tattoo does not impact or impede its other effects in any way. Once your Bardic
                              Inspiration die has increased, you may spend one hour performing a touch up on a tattoo you have previously invested with Lasting Inspiration. At the end of the hour, you expend one use of your
                              Bardic Inspiration. Once this is complete, the Lasting Inspiration die increases to your current Bardic Inspiration die. You cannot perform touch ups in this way on another artist’s tattoos. In
                              addition, you are now considered to have achieved the necessary tattoo artist notoriety required to study under an established tattoo adept, even if you have never maintained a shop
       - Magical Tattoo Flash: you can create magical flash art using your Calligrapher’s Supplies. To create magical flash art, you must spend a use of your Bardic Inspiration and take 10 minutes working on the art piece, which
                               consumes one piece of paper or parchment. At the completion of the 10 minutes you spend a spell slot to cast any one bard spell you know into the flash art. The flash art then becomes a scroll, 
                               which can be activated with a command word of your choosing. When creating magical tattoo flash, you must fulfill all components and costs of the spell normally. Anything consumed in the casting 
                               of the spell is consumed. If you are interrupted for more than one round while creating magical tattoo flash, all time, materials and your expenditure of Bardic Inspiration are wasted. Finally, 
                               anyone who is proficient with Tattooist’s Supplies who has access to a piece of your magical tattoo flash can use it to craft a magical tattoo granting the bearer the ability to cast the spell once
                               per long rest. Using magical tattoo flash in this fashion consumes the flash, but also allows the magical tattoo flash to fulfill the place of the spellcaster in the requirements for creating 
                               magical tattoos (see Scarred Lands Player’s Guide, Chapter Seven.)
                               - Magic Tattoos: Each body part can have only one magic tattoo. These rules assume a humanoid creature will have one head, one torso, two arms and two legs, for a maximum of five magic tattoos. 
                                                Please note that a magic tattoo can be placed on any available body part unless the item description says otherwise. Tattoos carrying Bardic Inspiration through the Lasting 
                                                Inspiration class feature do not count as magical for the purposes of determining whether a body part is used, unless those tattoos are also magical. Tattoos created through the 
                                                Tattoo Adept’s Dancing Ink feature also do not count against this maximum.
                                                
                                                
                                                
   - - College of Whispers Abilities:
       - Psychic Blades: you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an 
                         additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn. The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6
                         at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.
       - Words of Terror: you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its 
                          mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in 
                          this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to 
                          frighten it. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.
       - Mantle of Whispers: you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or 
                             you finish a long rest. You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy 
                             and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual 
                             acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by 
                             drawing on its memories. Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check. 
                             Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Shadow Lore: you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears. As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can
                      hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your 
                      whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It interprets 
                      the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it. While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for 
                      fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend. When the 
                      effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

                                                to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.

                            You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until 
                            you roll it again. You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale. If the tale requires a saving throw,
                            the DC equals your spell save DC.
