   - - Path of the Beast Abilities:
       - Form of the Beast: when you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your 
                            Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal. You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage;
                            Bite: Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you 
                                  regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.
                            Claws: Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the 
                                   Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.
                            Tail: You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use 
                                  your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
       - Bestial Soul: the feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You 
                       can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest;
                       - You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.

       - Infectious Fury: when you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
                          Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice);
                          - The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
                          - Target takes 2d12 psychic damage.
                          You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Call the Hunt: the beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing 
                        creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends
                        the chosen creatures can use the following benefit once on each of their turns; when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to 
                        the damage equal to the number rolled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

       - Mindless Rage: you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.
       - Intimidating Presence: you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must 
                                succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your 
                                action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet 
                                away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
       - Retaliation: when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
       
       
       
   - - Path of the Ancestral Guardian Abilities:
         - Ancestral Protectors: spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until 
                                 the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has

         - Consult the Spirits: you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a 
                                spherical sensor, this use of Clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either spell
                                in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
         - Vengeful Ancestors: your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage that your Spirit Shield 
                               prevents.

                         teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be 
                         unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow. Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. 
                         For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.
                         - Bear: While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

                                       is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.
                               - Eagle: While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you
                                        aloft.
                               - Elk: While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your

   - - Path of the Zealot Abilities:
         - Divine Fury: you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your Barbarian level.
                        The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.
         - Warrior of the Gods: your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as Raise Dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the 
                                spell on you.
         - Fanatical Focus: the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.
         - Zealous Presence: you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you
                             that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
         - Rage Beyond Death: the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you 
                              suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still
                              have 0 hit points.
                              
                              
                              
   - - Path of Wild Magic Abilities:
         - Magic Awareness: as an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn’t 
                            behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses 
                            when you finish a long rest.
         - Wild Surge: the magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced. If the effect requires a saving throw, the 
                       DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
                       Wild Surge Table:
                       d8  Effect
                       1   Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. You also gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 plus your 
                           barbarian level.
                       2   You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.
                       3   An intangible spirit, which looks like a flumph or a pixie (your choice), appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, 
                           the spirit explodes, and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again, summoning another 
                           spirit, on each of your turns as a bonus action.
                       4   Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your rage ends, the weapon's damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 
                           feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn.
                       5   Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before your rage ends, that creature takes 1d6 force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution.
                       6   Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by multicolored, protective lights; you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus.
                       7   Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you; until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.
                       8   A bolt of light shoots from your chest. Another creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you rust succeed on a Constitution Saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage and be blinded 
                           until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.
         - Bolstering Magic: you can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature;
                             - For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll.
                             - Roll a d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature’s choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can’t 
                               receive it again until after a long rest.
                             You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
         - Unstable Backlash: when you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out; immediately after you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use your reaction to roll on the Wild Magic
                              table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.
         - Controlled Surge: whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose 
                             any effect on the table.
