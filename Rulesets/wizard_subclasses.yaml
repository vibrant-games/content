               uses the chosen skill if you are proficient in that skill. At levels 6, 10 and 14 you get to choose one more skill from the list. In addition, your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, 
               rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice). Your proficiency bonus is also doubled for any ability check that uses
               the Investigation skill if you are proficient in that skill. neither this feature nor the previous feature gives proficiency in any skill           
    - title: Spell Secrets
    - content: You start to master your first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies. Choose two damage types from acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant or thunder. When you 
               cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and the spell deals one of the chosen damage types you can substitute that damage type with another (previously) chosen damage type from the list. You can use this 
               feature a number of times equal to your Inteligence Modifier (minimum of once~ and only a single damage type may be substituted per spell You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. At 
               levels 6, 10 and 14 you get to choose two more damage types from the list. Additionally, when you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from
               one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Arcane Analyser
    - content: You learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic
               into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend. An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, 
               increase the damage against one target of your choice by 2dl0 force damage. lfthe spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell. An 
               additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell's range. If the spell's range is at least 30 feet, it's range is tripled, or it becomes 1/4 of a mile (whichever is greater) An additional 3rd-
               level spell slot can increase the spell's potency. Increase the spell's save DC by 2 for one turn against all targets.

               you finish a long rest. Additionally, pick two more skills from the list mentioned in Lore Master. If you are proficient in the skills you chose, your proficiency bonus is doubled when you make a 
               check using that skill. If you are not proficient in that skill, you become proficient.
    - title: Master of Magic
    - content: Your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spelL but doing so too frequently will have consequences as the efforts needed to do it wears out both mind and body. As a bonus action, you 
               can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any class's spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn't have it prepared, and you follow the 
               normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn't a wizard spelL it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when 
               you finish casting or concentrating (if applicable) on it. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, and if you use it more than five times per tenday you gain one level of 
               exhaustion and your hit point maximum is lowered by 5d8 + (5 times the number of uses after the fifth use) psychic damage per use after the fifth use. The only way to heal the damage and begin lowering 
               your levels of exhaustion caused by this feature is by finishing another long rest. These effects cannot be reduced or negated in any way by anything other a direct intervention from a deity or careful 
               usage of a legendary, sentient artifact magic item which has the appropriate effects (like The Fates card from the Deck of Many Things) and the damage ignores resistance or immunity conferred by 
               anything other than of equal or greater power to that of an artifact

               unable to cast spells other than can trips on your next turn.
    - title: Arcane Thread
    - content: You learned about the effect of casting magic in the fabric of space. You have learned to passively thread a mix of magic and soul onto space, this string is intangible unless touched by you. This causes 
               every targeting spell that is cast within 120 feet of you to create a thread that remains in place for 30 seconds. You can use your bonus action to pull all strings close to you. Successfully hitting the 
               target attaches the string. Pulling all strings attached to an enemy will rip the fabric of space slightly dealing force damage equal to number of strings attached times your intelligence modifier. The 
               strings that were pulled immediately vanish. Pulling 5 or more strings creates a void in space that pulls all creatures within 10 feet of the target. Creatures must succeed on a strength save against your

               and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement. Once you use this 
               feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.

    - title: Sculpt Spells
    - content: You can create pockets of relative safety within the Effects of your Evocation Spells. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them 
               equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their Saving Throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
    - title: Potent Cantrip
    - content: Your damaging Cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the Effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) 
               but suffers no additional Effect from the cantrip.

               feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the necrotic damage per Spell Level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores Resistance and immunity.

               that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage
               reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher,
               the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Projected Ward
    - content: When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded
               creature takes any remaining damage.
    - title: Improved Abjuration

               or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each
               foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls
    - title: Expert Divination
    - content: Casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain
               one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level
    - title: The Third Eye

  - title: Order of Scribes Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Wizardly Quill
    - content: As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties
               The quill doesn’t require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
               The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
               You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.
               This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die
    - title: Awakened Spellbook
    - content: Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook. At 2nd level, while you are holding the book, 
               it grants you the following benefits - 
               You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
               When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula 
               for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
               When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long 
               rest.
               If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end 
               of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed 
               somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.
    - title: Manifest Mind
    - content: You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space
               of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a 
               scholar from the past (your choice). While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears
               (no action required). Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per
               day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you
               or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts Dispel Magic on it, if the Awakened 
               Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action. Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 
               any level to conjure it again.
    - title: Master Scrivner
    - content: Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied 
               onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the 
               spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell 
               vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest. You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
               The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill
    - title: One with the Word
    - content: Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, 
               as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore. Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss 
               the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, 
               if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't
               enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points. Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another
               spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spell book. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest
                            
                            
                            
  - title: School of Transmutation Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Transmutation Savant
    - content: The gold and time you must spend to copy a Transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.
    - title: Minor Alchemy
    - content: When you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one 
               object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you 
               can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
    - title: Transmuters Stone
    - content: You can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice 
               as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options;
               Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet
               An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered
               Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
               Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)
               Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases
               to function.
    - title: Shapechanger
    - content: You add the Polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast 
               whose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast Polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot
    - title: Master Transmuter

               Restore Youth - You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.

    - title: Illusory Reality
    - content: You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical 
               object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can 
               create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross. The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

    - title: Enchantment Savant
    - content: The gold and time you must spend to copy a Enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.
    - title: Hypnotic Gaze
    - content: When you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or 
               hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is 
               incapacitated and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more
               than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against 
               this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Instinctive Charm
    - content: When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The 
               attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple 
               creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this 
               feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
    - title: Split Enchantment
    - content: When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.
    - title: Alter Memories
    - content: You gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it 
               remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must 
               succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less
               time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

               long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with Dispel Magic or Counterspell, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you 
               end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge. Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to 
               that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.

    - title: Undead Thralls
    - content: You add the Animate Dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as 
               appropriate. Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits;
               The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.

               Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature
               again. Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence 
               of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

               (each can come from different Lists). You Learn three additional cantrips in this way at wizard level 6, 10 and 14. Cantrips learned in this way count as wizard cantrips for you.
    - title: Big on the Basics
    - content: Your heightened study of cantrip magic is asserted by the ease with which it is cast and maintained. You can simultaneously concentrate on a cantrip and one other spell. In addition, you can dismiss 
               any number of cantrips or cantrip effects as a bonus action. Lastly, cantrips you cast don't need material components and only need either a verbal or somatic component (you choose which when casting)
    - title: Practice Makes Perfect
    - content: Well-practised cantrips benefit from your considerable expertise, honed to the verge of perfection. When you cast a can trip, choose one of the following benefits to apply to it

               If the cantrip has a duration of 1 minute or Longer, you can choose to either double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours, or increase its duration to 1 hour.
               The cantrip's targets have disadvantage on saving throws made against it, and you have advantage on the next attack roll made with that cantrip during the current turn.
               If the cantrip's effects would end when you cast it again, they instead end when you cast it again while you already have two or more instances or that cantrip active.

               when casting a cantrip, you can now choose up to two of Practice Made Per£ect's effects to apply to it instead of one.

    - content: When you select this school, you can write small glyphs upon a surface or an object, embedding a magical effect into your writing. Using a 1 minute ritual, you can write a glyph upon a surface or object no 
               larger than 5 ft. in diameter. lf you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast it, the glyph is broken, and it ends without being 
               triggered. The glyphs created last for 24 hours or until you move more than 500 feet away from them. You may have a number of glyphs active equal to your intelligence modifier. The glyph is nearly invisible
               and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. The glyph is triggered when a creature other than its creator moves within 5 feet of it. You can further 
               refine the trigger so the glyph activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect 
               aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe a glyph, choose alerting glyph or
               cantrip glyph.
    - content: Alerting Glyph - When triggered, this glyph alerts you with a ping in your mind. The ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
    - content: Cantrip Glyph - You can store a cantrip that you know by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast
                               in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is 
                               centered on that creature. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
    - title: Expert Warding
    - content: You add the glyph of warding spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast glyph of warding, you no longer need to provide material components, and the spell's cast time is reduced to
               10 minutes.
    - title: Major Glyph
    - content: When you create a glyph using your minor glyph feature, you can use more powerful spell effects. When you inscribe a glyph, you can choose spell glyph.
    - content: Spell Glyph - You can store a prepared spell of 1st level in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate
                             effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, 
                             the area is centered on that creature. Ifthe spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell 
                             requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. If you choose this option, the casting time of the ritual is increased to 10 minutes. You may not have multiple spell-glyphs
                             active at a time, but they do not count against your total number of glyphs active.
    - title: Master of Glyphcraft
    - content: You add the symbol spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast symbol, you no longer need to provide material components.

  - abilities: 
    - title: Aegis of the Hieromancer
    - content: Your studies in the defense of the law have improved your defenses in combat. Your AC is calculated using your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier (this includes any armor 
               you wear). In addition, a shield can be your arcane focus.
    - title: Arcane Edict
    - content: Your studies into arcane law magic have allowed you imbue your words with the essence of order. As a bonus action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom 
               saving throw against your spell save DC. The arcane essence of your words still affects a creature that can't understand you. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the target again until you 
               finish a long rest. On a failure, they are bound by your words. You can choose following edict options
    - content: Bind - A creature becomes restrained. They drop whatever they were holding.
    - content: Silence - A creature becomes mute. Any non-verbal communication the creature attempts fails.
    - content: Surrender - A creature becomes prone and is no longer hostile towards you or your allies. Creatures immune to the charmed condition remain hostile.
                           A creature under the effects of an arcane edict can use its action to make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC. On a failure, it cannot take this action for 10 minutes. On a success, it frees 
                           itself. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Bonus Proficiencies
    - content: You gain proficiency with medium armor (excluding hide) and shields.
    - title: Improved Law Magic
    - content: You add the counterspell and shield spells to your spellbook if they are not there already. If you already know these spells, you learn a different wizard spell of your choice. When you successfully 
               negate an attack or spell with any spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to your wizard level + your spell’s level. Additionally, you can cast the shield spell on a creature within 30 feet.
    - title: Rule of Law
    - content: When you use your arcane edict you can choose all three options to apply to a creature. Furthermore, creatures affected by your arcane edict have disadvantage on rolls made to break or escape your edict.
    - title: Suppression Bonds
    - content: You demand everyone act on an even playing field. As an action, choose one of following
    - content: Magic Suppression - In a 90-foot radius centered on you, creatures struggle cast spells successfully. Any creature attempting to cast a spell must make an ability check at disadvantage with their 
                                   spellcasting ability. The DC is 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fizzles out. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest.
    - content: Martial Suppression - In a 90-foot radius centered on you, creatures struggle to physically attack other creatures. Any creature attempting to attack something must make either a Strength or Dexterity 
                                     check with disadvantage. The DC is your spell save DC. On a failure, the attack fails and the attack drops any weapons they're holding. This effect lasts until you finish a long 
                                     rest. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
