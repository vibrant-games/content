                       of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active 
                       rite at a time. You learn an additional Primal Rite of your choice at 7th level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14th level.
                       Primal Rites Known: 
       - Extra Attack: you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
       - Brand of Castigation: whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded 
                               creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier 
                               (minimum of 1 damage). Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to 
                               half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Grim Psychometry: you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past 
                           surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and
                           sometimes conveys visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.	
       - Dark Augmentation: Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
       - Brand of Tethering: the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature 
                             branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane 
                             shift fails.
       - Hardened Soul: you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.
       - Sanguine Mastery: Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with 
                           a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.

   - - Pugilist Abilities:
       - Fisticuffs: your years of fighting in back alleys and taverns have given you mastery over combat styles that use unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons, which are simple melee weapons without the two-handed property, whips,
                     and improvised weapons. You may not use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a pugilist weapon. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or using only pugilist weapons and you are

                of points you have, as shown in the Moxie Points column of the Pugilist table. You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. You start knowing three such features -  Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick 
                and Move. You learn more moxie features as you gain levels in this class. You regain all expended moxie points when you complete a short or long rest.
                - Brace Up: You can use a bonus action and spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. Roll your fisticuffs die + your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier and gain that many temporary hit points.

                     description. Your fight club grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
       - Dig Deep: you discover a strength inside you that can’t be broken. As a bonus action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for one minute. At the end of that minute you gain a level of 
                   exhaustion.
       - Extra Attack: you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
       - Haymaker: before you make an attack roll with an unarmed strike or pugilist melee weapon attack that does not already have disadvantage, you can declare you are swinging wild haymakers. You make all attack rolls until 
                   the end of this turn with disadvantage and when you deal damage you do not roll, but use the maximum die result instead.
       - Moxie-Fueled Fists: your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

       - Peak Physical Condition: your Strength and Constitution ability scores increase by 2 to a maximum of 22. Additionally, when you take a long rest you recover 2 levels of exhaustion instead of 1 and you regain all your 
                                  expended hit dice instead of half your expended hit dice

                           and it can hover (familiars that already have flight speeds keep their value, but lose their walking speed like the others) and it can become invisible with an action.

                                 any other personal features. You don't gain its hit points, AC, or any special types of movement (like flight). Changes in Dex or Con do not effect your AC or HP and only apply for the sake of

                                 your weapon on the attack, so, if you use a ranged weapon, like a bow, you can still make any attack from your spirit, like a bite attack. Also, any extra damage, or bonus to attack rolls you gain 
                                 from magical weapons still affect your spirit attacks.
                               - Your spirit's senses overlap yours, so you lose any senses you possess that your spirit doesn't posses with exception to your ethereal sight.
                               - At level 7 your spirit's attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity against nonmagical damage and attacks. When you reach 11th level, you gain temporary

                                you.

       - Vengeful Spirits: when targeting a creature with a spell that forces them to make a Wisdom saving throw you can choose to loose angry spirits along with the spell. Once per short rest, you can use this feature to make 
                           the target make their initial Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed saving throw the spirits torment the target's mind, causing the spell to deal double damage, or last twice as long, your 
                           choice if the spell has a duration and causes damage. On a success, nothing happens.
       - Grand Shaman: you can use your Spirit Possession an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your shaman spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and

       - Witch Covenant: you choose the Covenant of Blood, the Covenant of Charm, the Covenant of Ruin, the Covenant of Shadows, or the Covenant of Unity, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you 
                         features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Additionally, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it once without using a spell slot. You cannot do so again until you finish a 
                         long rest. As long as you have a familiar you gain access to spells regardless of the familiar's distance or occupied plane of existence.
       - Binding Rites: you can bind spirits to your service, taking 10 minutes of uninterrupted activity. During this time, the witch enacts the rite of binding depending on which philosophy the witch belongs to. A blood witch 
                        might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit’s service. When you choose a spirit to bind from the list 
                        at the end of this class description, you fill one of your available spell slots with the spirit. The spell slot used is no longer available for casting spells, and it remains unavailable for as long as 
                        the spirit filling it remains bound to you. The spirit is said to be of a level equal to the spell slot filled to bind it. Thus, a Spirit of Passion occupying a 6th level spell slot is a level 6 spirit. 
                        You cannot have more than one spirit with the same name bound at one time. You can have a number of spirits bound equal to the number in the class table. Depending on the type of spirit, you gain certain 
                        benefits while the spirit remains bound and an additional effect when you release the spirit, as detailed in the Binding Rites section. Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow 
                        release as a reaction. Once a spirit has been released, it no longer provides its passive effect and the spell slot it occupied is considered expended. A witch may exchange any spirit they have bound by 
                        performing the ritual as described above.
       - Spirit Ward: you learn a rite that offers protection against spirits who wish you or your allies harm. As an action, you can create a spirit ward with a radius of 30 feet, centered on your location. The ward lasts 1 
                      minute and is stationary for the duration. While inside the ward, friendly creatures (yourself included) cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by undead and have resistance to all damage from 
                      incorporeal undead sources. Additionally, if a friendly creature is reduced to 0 hit points within the ward but is not killed outright, the creature becomes stable. You can use this feature 3 times. You 
                      regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 9th level, you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
       - Spiritual Spellcasting: you may call upon the spirits you have bound to help you cast your spells. You may dismiss a spirit as a bonus action to recover a spell slot of a level equal to that of the spirit’s. The release 
                                 effect of the spirit you dismissed is not activated.
       - Channel Spell: damage you deal with spells of 1st level or higher ignore damage resistances of undead and creatures on the Ethereal Plane. In addition, any damage immunities of these creatures become resistances to your 
                        spells of 1st level or higher.
       - Strength of Spirit: you learn to sap additional fortitude from the spirits you bind. When you finish a long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 times the highest level spirit you have bound.
       - Familiar Spirit: when cast find familiar or if you already have a familiar, you can awaken spiritual energy within the animal as part of an additional ritual taking 10 minutes. Once complete, you choose one spirit from 
                          the list at the end of the class description. Its level is equal to your Charisma modifier. Your familiar provides you with the spirit’s passive effect as long as your familiar is within 100 feet of you. 
                          If the familiar dies, the spirit you initially chose produces its release effect if you can see any valid targets within range of the familiar when it dies.
       - Ghostly Step: you gain the ability to enter the spirit realm as a bonus action by projecting part of yourself beyond the material plane. You and your belongings become invisible and incorporeal for up to 1 minute. You 
                       gain resistance to all damage from non-magical sources, and are immune to being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained. During this time, you may move your normal speed and may pass through 
                       solid objects. If you end your turn in an object, you are dealt 1d10 force damage. You may rematerialize in your present location as a bonus action. If you choose to maintain this form until the duration 
                       expires and you are in a location occupied by a creature or solid object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved as a result. 
                       Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

                   any open wounds and applying painkillers where needed, whatever it takes to get them to the next battle. This cures them of any non-magical ailments and restores a number of hit points equal to half of their

                 an unwilling creature for the same effect. An unwilling target must be below one quarter of its maximum hit points for this ability to take effect. They must then succeed a Constitution saving throw or
                 immediately fall unconscious for 1d4 hours.
       - Practiced Hands: you have performed the same procedures countless times. Whenenever you use a healing ability, item, or other effect that involves a die roll you can add an additional healing die of the same type to the
                          end result, even if the result would otherwise be maximized.
       - Experimental Procedure: you recognize that the limitations of the mortal body are simply defects waiting to be corrected. You target a specific stat; Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
                                 and attempt to improve it. This may involve replacing organs, changing appearance, or altering brain chemistry. To be successful you must succeed on a DC25 Medicine check or the procedure fails.
                                 On a success the target gains a permanent +1 bonus to the targeted ability score. You may not attempt this procedure on the same target more than 3 times, regardless of success or failure. Due
                                 to your skills a failure does not inflict any negative effects on the target, but the target receives no benefits. The procedure takes eight hours from start to finish, and cannot be paused or
                                 interrupted. The targeted creature takes five days to recover, and remains incapacitated.
