    - title: Awaken the Blood
    - content: When you release a spirit from your power, you can use the energy from those broken spiritual bonds to repair corporeal bodies. When you release a spirit, a creature you touch regains hit points equal 
               to three times the spirit's level.
    - title: Sympathetic Magic
    - content: You gain the power to cast spells on targets over vast distances beyond what the spell may ordinarily allow. Provided you have an article (blood, hair, clothing, or favoured object) from the target, 
               your spells of 5th level or lower which have a single target may affect the creature if it is on the same plane of existence as you. When you cast a spell that targets a creature in this way, the 
               article you have from the target is consumed.
    - title: Blood Binding
    - content: When a hostile creature dies within 30 feet of you, you can bind its soul as a reaction. You bind a spirit type of your choice to a spell slot of your choice. This binding expires after 24 hours or 
               whenever you use this ability again. The target cannot be resurrected so long as its spirit remains bound in this way. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
               again.
    - title: Call Forth the Flesh
    - content: You gain the ability to force an ethereal or incorporeal creature that you can see within 60 feet into the material plane as an action. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or 
               lose their incorporeal movement trait and immunities to grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, and restrained for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can use this feature to to cast revivify once without 
               expending a spell slot or material components. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

    - title: In Perfect Trust
    - content: You have grown attuned to the hearts and minds of those around you. While in your quickening, you can add your proficiency bonus to Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks, or twice your 
               proficiency bonus if you are already proficient. Additionally, during your quickening, you gain the ability peer into the heart of a creature within 60 feet of you as an action. The target must succeed
               on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or you gain insight into its emotional state and something that is currently influencing this state such as something it worries over, desires, loves,
               or hates. Constructs and creatures immune to being charmed automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a failed save the target is not aware of this intrusion. Once you use this feature, you must 
               finish a long rest before you can use it again.
    - title: Spirit Token
    - content: You can tie one of your spirits you already have bound to a small object. As an action, you bind the spirit to an object that is significant to a creature you choose, the spirit still counts towards your 
               maximum bonds while attached to the object. As long as the creature is in possession of the token, the spirit provides its passive effect as though the spirit were bound by the target (even if they are not
               a witch). In either case, the magic holding the spirit to the object expires after 24 hours when it returns to your control. If the token is returned to you, you can break this magic sooner as a bonus 
               action, regaining use of the spirit.
    - title: Of One Heart
    - content: Creatures charmed by you are also considered charmed by your allies. Additionally, when you trigger a spirit's release effect, until the start of your next turn allies within 60 feet of you can damage 
               charmed creatures without affecting the charm.
    - title: Crux of Desire
    - content: You can't be charmed or frightened, and your spells and spirits ignore immunity to the charmed condition.

    - title: Doom
    - content: The targets of your spirits’ release effects have disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll they make within the next 10 minutes.
    - title: Devastating Release
    - content: Spirits you release erupt with energy as their bonds are broken, causing harm to those around you. When you release a spirit, roll a number of d6s equal to the level of the spirit. Creatures of your
               choice within 30 feet of you take psychic damage equal to the total. Those who take damage hear wails and screams as the spirit is released, and feel a rush of sorrow and discomfort.
    - title: Ruinous Ward
    - content: The Spirit Wards you create are accompanied by spiritual dissonance which can strain and break the weak of soul. When a creature starts its turn inside your Spirit Ward, you can choose for the ward to deal
               3d6 psychic damage to the creature (no action required by you).
    - title: Rite of Exorcism
    - content: You can attempt to exorcise a living creature’s soul. If a creature within 30 feet of you fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against one of your spells or spirits' release effects, you can use 
               your reaction to attempt to exorcise that creature's soul. The target takes 5d6 psychic damage and 5d6 necrotic damage as their soul is torn from their body, and they are stunned until the end of your 
               next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

    - title: 9th Level
    - content: Mislead, Seeming
    - title: The Shadows Have Eyes
    - content: You can use the spirits which dwell in the darkness to see. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet as long as you have at least one spirit bound, 
               and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in dim light or darkness.
    - title: Blinding Shackles
    - content: Hostile creatures that are affected by any of your spirits’ release effects must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of its
               turns, a target can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. This ability has no effect on creatures who do not use light to see.
    - title: Dark Mimicry
    - content: As long as you have at least one spirit bound, you can call upon the movements of nearby shadows to replace the somatic components of your spells. Alternatively, the ghostly whispers of your bound spirit
               may replace the verbal components of your spells. You can therefore cast spells with these components even if you yourself cannot motion or vocalize. Additionally, when you are hidden from a creature and 
               cast a spell, casting the spell doesn't reveal your position to it.
    - title: Haunting Shades
    - content: After you release a spirit that targets a hostile creature, you can choose for the spirit to also haunt that creature for up to 1 minute, requiring your concentration as if on a spell. The passive 
               effect of the spirit continues but uses the haunted creature as the origin. The passive effect otherwise treats you as the owner. After 1 minute or when you lose concentration, the spirit’s release 
               effect activates again. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

    - title: 9th Level
    - content: Mislead, Scrying
    - title: Looking Glass
    - content: You gain a Tiny trinket known as a Soul Mirror. As an action you can face the mirror at a creature you can see and capture its reflection. The reflection remains captured until you release it as a bonus 
               action or use this feature again. As an action while you have a reflection captured, you can speak the name of the target to create an invisible sensor within 10 feet of it. The soul mirror then shows the
               view from the sensor as if it were there, instead of a reflection. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it until the target's reflection is released. A creature that can see 
               invisible objects sees the sensor as a translucent disc the size of your soul mirror. If you lose your Soul Mirror, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to summon a replacement. This ceremony can be 
               performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous mirror. The mirror shatters when you die.
    - title: Soul Shatter
    - content: If you have a reflection captured in your soul mirror, you can summon an eruption of ghostly mirror-shards whenever you release a spirit as a reaction to taking damage. The reflection is released along 
               with the spirit, and the target of the spirit's release effect takes force or radiant damage (your choice) equal to the triggering damage. You regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.
    - title: Soul Cloak
    - content: You can assume the form of the creature whose reflection you trapped in your soul mirror as an action. When you do so, the reflection is released and magically transforms into a disguise that appears on you.
               You now look like the creature, but flipped horizontally like a reflection. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. While you're in the disguise you can perfectly mimic the 
               mannerisms, speech patterns, accent, and other superficial qualities of the original creature. Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check with disadvantage 
               against your spell save DC. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
    - title: Dark Reflection
    - content: You can use your action to compel a creature you can see within 60 feet to look at a warped illusion of itself. The target sees you as a wretched, horrifying version of itself — a visage that 
               manipulates it with its insecurities and plays on its fears. You cast geas on the target without expending a spell slot or material components. When cast in this way, the target is also frightened of 
               you for the duration, and the duration of the spell is seven years. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

    - title: Bonus Proficiencies
    - content: You gain proficiency with medium armor, simple weapons and the longsword. If you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.
    - title: Fighting Style
    - content: You adopt a style of fighting as your speciality. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again. Blind 
               Fighting. Being unable to see a creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn’t hidden from you. Dueling. When you are wielding a melee weapon in one 
               hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Eerie. While you have a spirit bound, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
    - title: Imbue Weapon
    - content: You can channel the power of your bound spirits through a weapon. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and choose one spirit you have bound. The 
               spirit is infused into the weapon until you finish a long rest, and it cannot be released while it is infused in this way. When you attack with the weapon, it gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal
               to the spirit's level divided by three, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls. Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to
               your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Reflexes of Steel
    - content: Your physical and spiritual reflexes are razor sharp. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to the number of spirits you have bound. Additionally, when you make a saving throw 
               you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of spirits you have bound.
    - title: Steel Rain
    - content: Your body and soul have been forged and tempered by your training. As an action, you can release a spirit to unleash a flurry of spiritually fueled strikes. You make a number of weapon attacks equal to the 
               spirit's level, and the damage from these attacks ignores resistance and immunity. The spirit's release effect does not trigger. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

    - title: Spirit Link
    - content: You can effortlessly link yourself to the souls around you. While in your quickening you can use your action to discern whether a creature you can see has greater or fewer hit points than yourself and any 
               conditions it currently suffers from.
    - title: Forceful Presence
    - content: After you release a spirit you can choose to retain control over it, so that the spirit remains bound and ready to be released again. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma 
               modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Powerful Bonds
    - content: Your body and soul develop the ability to contain more powerful spirits. The passive and release effects of spirits you bind are considered one level higher than the spell slot you use to bind them.
    - title: Pale Host
    - content: If you are reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you are not knocked unconscious and your body becomes possessed by a spirit you control while you have 0 hit points. You remain conscious and 
               possessed in this way for 1 round per level of the highest level spirit you have bound. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage or regaining hit points while
               at 0 hit points. Onlookers notice a strangeness in your movements, eyes, and voice while you remain possessed. While possessed, you can use your action on your turn to activate the release effect of one of 
               the spirits you have bound and have it remain bound. This does not expend any uses of the Forceful Presence ability.
