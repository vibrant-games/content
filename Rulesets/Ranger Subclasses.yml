                         feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 
                         1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

       - Hunters Sense: you gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has 
                        any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities. You

       - Slayers Prey: you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each 
                       turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different 
                       creature.
       - Supernatural Defense: you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to

                              rest.
       - Slayers Counter: you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack 
                          against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.

       - Gathered Swarm: a swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. Until you die, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your
                         space. You determine its appearance. Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack; 
                         - The attack's target takes 1d6 piercing damage from the swarm.

                       - When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives you half cover until the start of your next turn.
       - Swarming Dispersal: you can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding danger. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage. You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an 
                             unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, where you reappear with the swarm. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended 
                             uses when you finish a long rest.

                          If the save fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
                          successful save.
       - Fey Reinforcements: the royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings; you know the spell Summon Fey. It doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast it 
                             without a material component. You can also cast it once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Whenever you start casting the spell, you can 
                             modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.
       - Misty Wanderer: you can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye; you can cast Misty Step without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once)
