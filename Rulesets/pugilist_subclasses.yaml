                        signifier (such as a mask, colorful cape, or another prominent idiosyncratic feature). Unless you tell a creature, or the creature sees you adopt your persona, they do not know you and the adopted persona

                         in your reach and, if you hit, the attack is a critical and the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn. If you hit with your signature move, you must finish a long rest before you can use it
