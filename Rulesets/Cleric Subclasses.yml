         9th Level: Greater Restoration, Rary's Telepathic Bond 
       - Emboldening Bond: you can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) and create a magical bond between them.
                           While either bonded creature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add 
                           the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again. You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can
                           also expend a spell slot to use the feature again.
       - Channel Divinity - Shared Burden: you can use your Channel Divinity to protect your allies through the strength of your shared bonds. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your 
                                           reaction to choose a number of other willing creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). Distribute the damage taken 
                                           between the original target and the chosen creatures. Each creature must take at least 1 damage. Apply any damage resistance or vulnerability of the creatures involved after you 
                                           distribute the damage.
       - Protective Bond: the bond you forge between people shields them from harm. While either creature chosen for your Emboldening Bond feature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can use its reaction to grant 
                          resistance to all damage to the other creature when that other creature takes damage. This resistance lasts until the end of the current turn.
       - Potent Spellcasting: you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 
       - Enduring Unity: the bonds you create endure across vast distances. Creatures affected by your Emboldening Bond feature gain its benefits, as well as those of your Protective Bond feature, while they are on the same 
                         plane of existence as each other. Additionally, when a creature chosen for your Emboldening Bond is reduced to 0 hit points, their bonded partner gains the following benefits for 1 minute, or until the 
                         creature regains at least 1 hit point;
                         - The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws
                         - The creature gains resistance to all damage
                         - As an action, the creature can touch their bonded partner to expend and roll any number of Hit Dice. Their bonded partner regains a number of hit points equal to the total rolled.

        - Invoke Duplicity: you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself. As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration 
                            (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet 
                            to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, 
                            when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target
        - Cloak of Shadows: you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell

                                                that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns 
                                                trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only 
                                                use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. After you reach 5th level, 
                                                when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the Banishment spell, no concentration required) if 
                                                it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.    
        - Spell Breaker: when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than

       - Blessing of the Forge: you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of 
                                your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon. Once you use this feature,
                                you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
       - Channel Divinity - Artisans Blessing: you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items. You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal; a simple or martial weapon, a 
                                               suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice 
                                               on a surface within 5 feet of you. The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, 
                                               with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. 
                                               The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

                                vision of an unlikely future involving threats that are not real or that you're unlikely to face, such as a betrayal from allies that are actually trustworthy, or an attack from monsters that 
                                aren't actually present in the immediate area. You can enter this trance a number of times equal to your cleric level divided by 4 (a minimum of once). 
       - Gift of Madness: you also learn how to ward off attackers by sharing your madness with them. Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to assault it with hallucinations. 
                          The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes psychic damage equal to 2 + half your cleric level and the hallucinations make it either blinded or deafened (your choice)
                          and frightened of you until the end of your next turn. You can use this reaction ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once).

                                            see within 60 feet. Each creature in a 10 foot sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes psychic damage equal to ld6 + 
                                            half your cleric level and it becomes  addled with dread for 1 minute. A creature addled with this dread treats all other creatures as enemies for the purpose of disadvantage for 
                                            ranged attacks, and must make any opportunity attack it  possibly can. At the end of an affected creature's turn, it repeats the saving throw. A success ends the effect on that 
                                            creature.

                            anything about a creature's capabilities or identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long 
                            rest.

                                               curse ends.
       - Sentinel at Deaths Door: you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any 
                                  effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long 
                                  rest.
       - Potent Spellcasting: you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
       - Keeper of Souls: you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you 
                          regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
