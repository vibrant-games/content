    background-story: |
      Yoloff has had a long and decorated career with the watch and is just waiting for his retirement pension to kick in so he can putter around his home full time. He knows the city like the back of his hand and has pretty much sen it all. Despite his comments to the contrary, he actually enjoys and takes pride in training and keeping the rookies safe on the job. Due to his advanced age, most of his duties consist of training and crowd control on the few days that he gets away from pushing paper at his desk at Watch HQ. He's been a good watchman for a long long time, but has been known to take the odd bribe to supplement his income as long, as it's not to ignore something that will directly hurt anyone.
