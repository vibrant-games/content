# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

   - - Kobold Traits: 
       - Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray
       - Grovel, Cower & Beg: As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that
                              can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Pack Tactics: You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
       - Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

       - Bardic Inspiration: Can use a Bonus Action on their Turn to choose one creature other than themself within 60 feet of, who can hear them. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d10. Once within the next 
                             10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
       - Jack of All Trades: can add half their Proficiency Bonus, rounded down, to any ability check they make that doesn't already include their Proficiency Bonus
       - Song of Rest: If they or any friendly creatures who can hear their Performance regain Hit Points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the Short Rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 Hit Points.
       - Font of Inspiration: they regain all of their expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when they finish a short or Long Rest
       - Countercharm: As an action, they can start a Performance that lasts until the end of their next turn. During that time, them and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of them have advantage on Saving Throws against 
                       being Frightened or Charmed
       - Expertise: gets double proficiency bonus in
       - Magical Secrets: Choose two Spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip: Sending, Scrying
       
   - - College of Whispers Abilities:
       - Psychic Blades: you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an 
                         additional 5d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.
       - Words of Terror: you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its
                          mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in
                          this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to
                          frighten it. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.
       - Mantle of Whispers: you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or
                             you finish a long rest. You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy
                             and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual
                             acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by
                             drawing on its memories. Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.
                             Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.

    background-story: |
     Kobolds are kobolds. Well, not always. Symmetry (not her birth name) was raised in a cavern den of the hundreds of kobolds making up the clan of Kut-Kut.  They were dedicated to serving the Red Dragon, Vys, who lived deeper
     in the mountain. Vys would task the clan with securing the cavern tunnels and with raiding nearby trading routes for treasures to pile atop his horde. One evening, Vys heard her singing and demanded she sit atop his horde
     for the rest of her life to entertain him. Not a great deal in the mind of anybody, really, even a kobold, and Symmetry (again, not her birth name, but she won't tell) grew disenfranchised with her life with Vys and her
     clan's unwillingness to stand up to the tyrant dragon. Vys would sleep often and would wake easily. He abhorred her silence and would punish her for it. She found a cunning solution. "Vys, you want newer songs? You must be
     getting bored of the ones I know", she whispered in his ear in draconic. "Yes," the dragon's deep growl trembled the piles of gold and treasures, "I am." The dragon chuckled sardonically. "Well, I must read to learn new
     songs. And to read I must be quiet." "Ay. Then silence for an hour." The great red dragon purred. Symmetry (again, I insist not her birth name) took an hour each day to learn more songs, more spells, and more knowledge
     from the tomes and treasures that littered Vys' lair. When a commanding officer of the Kut-Kut tribe rushed in one day to alert Vys that a small party of heroes had breached the cave depths, chaos ensued. Little did Vys
     know, this was a ruse created by a small group of rebels who sought to escape the caverns. In the ensuing chaos, Symmetry was able to distract Vys with songs and aid in their escape. The small kobold crew bonded over the
     weeks of travel that followed and set their sites on using their abilities to gain their own wealth. Upon arriving in a nearby city, they set forth to 'relieve' the population of their wealth. On a night of rest in a
     removed alleyway, Symmetry's song of her groups' exploits was overheard by a beggarly human who knew the value of being able to aid in disbanding this group of bandits and, perhaps even more so, the value of informing the
     watch as to the location of Vys' lair. He turned the information over for a handsome reward. The Regional Watch found the band of kobolds with haste. Symmetry was a primary target with her bright clothes and distinct
     appearance. However, using the secrets found in Vys' lair, Symmetry was able to terrify the Watchman and escape. The rest of her band scattered. Symmetry has been in flight ever since and makes a good living from selling
     her secrets - via letter - to the Regional Watch; sending them on wild goose chases.
