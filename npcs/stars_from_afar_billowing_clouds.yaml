# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Although still highly spiritual and loyal to his tribe at his core, Afar's time with the tinkering Hill Gnomes of Riddiruck Falls changed him. Always a bright Tabaxi, he was never given the chance to realize his true
     calling until introduced to tinkering. When his nomadic tribe came upon the village and befriended the genius gnomes, it wasn't long before AFar bid farewell to his tribe in favor of studying the arts of technology and
     artifice. He stayed in the village late into his life and was a collaborator on many of their greatest cityscape inventions. As old age set in, so did senility of sorts. Although still highly skilled and able to apply
     himself to his processes of invention, he has become a sort of wandering Don Quixote figure. This inventor cat-man with scruffy beard, pronounced tabard, bronze morion, and iron mastiff, is looking to bring light to the
     lives of others through his wild inventions. With his natural charm accented by his 'lost kitty' Quixotic creativity, he has established himself as a local merchant who incomprehensibly wheels and deals in his inventions
     and other remarkable goods. He is always rummaging through the city garbage and will never turn down purchasing 'trade-in' oddities and 'another man's garbage'.

    #
    personality: |
     Afar, as he is generally known, is a strange old cat-man. A talented and inventive artificer, he mostly uses found materials and traded garbage for his inventions. In his advanced age he is gradually going senile and has
     more and more frequent bouts of delirium which make him quite the character.
