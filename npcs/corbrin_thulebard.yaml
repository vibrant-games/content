    background-story: |
      <p>Corbrin is a decorated military veteran of the feared order of echo knights. He lost his arm quelling and insurrection against the government by Drow rebels. After losing his arm, he no longer felt capable of front-line military service. He was still a capable fighter and knew his weapons and armor well and spent some time training new recruits to the military.</p><p> After that he moved to the City Watch and continued training younger recruits. Eventually he decided it was time to retire from service and live quiet and stress-free for the rest of his life. To that end, he took a job working for an old friend of his, selling arms and armor from his provisions shop. He is knowledgeable and friendly despite his appearance and enjoys imparting his knowledge on anyone willing to listen.</p>
