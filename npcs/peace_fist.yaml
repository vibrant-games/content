# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Peace Fist was created as a messenger and tax collector for the Orzhov Syndicate on the plane of Ravnica. He carried out his duties, extorting money and hunting debtors for the Church of Coin. After several years of 
      watching the suffering of the Orzhov`s "congregation", they began to have doubts about their "calling". As he looked deeper into the workings of his "church", they found more and more that they didn't like what they 
      saw. Abuse, extortion, debt slavery. They found that the Obzedat, the Orzhov's ruling body was just a bunch of old miserly ghosts. Realizing that they too were also just a slave with nicer chains, they rebelled but 
      were put down. He was carted off in chains and was powered down in his cell. That was the last thing they remember before being found in the bottom of a dark tomb by The Phantom. No longer on Ravnica and having no 
      idea how much time had passed and no recollection of anything in between. They have dedicated themselves to their new savior and his mission to keep people safe from fiends and the undead. Using his speed and monastic 
      abilities, they function as messenger and scout for The Dead Hunters, but is definitely no slouch when it comes to combat either, as much as they prefer to avoid it. Also, Peace Fist is not their given name, but they 
      don't actually remember their name and that's what The Phantom has dubbed them.

    personality: |
      Peace Fist is a tall, lithe, muscular Warforged. Their body is constructed of several different types and colors of metal and organic matter. Their monastic training has left them strong and incredibly fast and agile. 
      They are calm, reserved and level-headed. They are not the smartest, but their ability to turn thought into action is unparalelled. Deft and quick-witted they are great at thinking on their feet. They are fiercly loyal 
      and ferverently loathe ghosts and slavers.
