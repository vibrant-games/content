# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      A beautiful pig can be someone's pride and joy. The smoothness and pink hues of its skin worthy of admiration from fellow livestockers. Fot learned this early in his years as his family of Hill Goblins toiled away at
      producing and grooming the finest pigs anyone had seen. Perhaps they worked with such fervor because they sought to clear the dirt off the name 'Goblin'. Perhaps they toiled so hard because they just loved pigs that much.
      Who knows? Doesn't matter to Fot. All that matters to Fot is that the pigs are healthy, smooth, and with that perfect shade of pink that makes you kiss your fingers and say, "muah". Pigs weren't their only trophies.
      Fot's family also produce what they believe to be the finest Folla Tubers and Gum Beans in the region, among other vegetables. With a staunch work ethic and a kind and respectful attitude uncommon from Goblins directed
      towards the merchants and traders of the nearby villages and cities, Fot and his family have established a stable standard of living. But not without further hard work. Little Fot continues his daily 16 hour grind to and
      from trading centers and market squares as a purveyor of fine livestock and farmed goods. He is also a committed competitor in the bi-annual pig competition, "Cochonatico", and has numerous ribbons and trophies to show-off.
