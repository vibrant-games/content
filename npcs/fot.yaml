    background-story: |
      <p>A beautiful pig can be someone's pride and joy. The smoothness and pink hues of its skin worthy of admiration from fellow livestockers. Fot learned this early in his years as his family of Hill Goblins toiled away at producing and grooming the finest pigs anyone had seen. Perhaps they worked with such fervor because they sought to clear the dirt off the name 'Goblin'. Perhaps they toiled so hard because they just loved pigs that much. Who knows? Doesn't matter to Fot. All that matters to Fot is that the pigs are healthy, smooth, and with that perfect shade of pink that makes you kiss your fingers and say, "muah".</p><p> Pigs weren't their only trophies. Fot's family also produce what they believe to be the finest Folla Tubers and Gum Beans in the region, among other vegetables. With a staunch work ethic and a kind and respectful attitude uncommon from Goblins directed towards the merchants and traders of the nearby villages and cities, Fot and his family have established a stable standard of living. But not without further hard work. Little Fot continues his daily 16 hour grind to and from trading centers and market squares as a purveyor of fine livestock and farmed goods. He is also a committed competitor in the bi-annual pig competition, "Cochonatico", and has numerous ribbons and trophies to show-off.</[>
