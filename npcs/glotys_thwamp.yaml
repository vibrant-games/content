    background-story: |
      <p>Glotys had a simple and genuine upbringing by a Dwarven family in love with the wilderness. They lived in a small village on the outskirts of the great hill Dwarf Empire of Ualen [any major Dwarven Empire] renown for their generosity in supplying the rest of the realm with forged goods, gems, and precious ores. Her peoples' passion for what wealth and goods lay within the hills did not appeal to her. Instead, Glotys took a liking to the nature above ground. The blooming of flowers and how their pollenation by bees rejeuvenated the life that flourished above ground.</p><p>Her passion for bees was so profound that as she learned more and more about the ecology of her surroundings the busy little insects were drawn to her. Her hard work and staunch dedication to learning more of her surroundings were rewarded with certain magicks that enable her to communicate with the tiny pollenators and call on them for help. These moments inspired her to begin an endeavour to provide housing and even greater love and support to these important components of the ecosystem.</p>
