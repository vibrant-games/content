# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    introduction:  Khedoldosh maintains a tent/hut at the outskirts of a market or tavern district with a sign above the entrance that glows with faint magical energy and reads, /"TELLINGS/". It can also be found slowly and carefully wandering from alleyway entrance to alley entrance. It may approach a group to ask for their help to obtain glyphs or sigils of farsight and offer to divulge important information in return.

    appearance:   A tiny, beholder - the runt of the litter that was summoned that day, you could say - that never developed properly; drapes a cloak over itself and uses well-crafted fake arms and its innate magical capacity to operate them as though real; Perception check (DC 22) allows a person to notice this is not a humanoid; They lean they're body to one side, their right, showing them one gleaming working eye while they have a prosthetic that remains closed to represent their left eye; their remaining eyes are all underdeveloped or dead and stay limp, tied into a ponytail along with their prosthetic hair

      It desires knowing more. About anything. Yet is trapped in the paradox of already believing it knows more than others. Hoping for a revelation to free it from this cognitive prison, Khedolosh remains eternally frustrated. It is driven to uncover the unknown yet knows that revealing the unknown destroys mystery.

  - title: Beholderkin Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Darkvision
    - content: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray
    - title: Bite
    - content: Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit 8 (2d6) piercing damage.
    - title: Antimagic Cone
    - content: The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether
               the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.
    - title: Eye Rays
    - content: The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it;
               Charm Ray - The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.
               Paralyzing Ray - The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
                                on a success.
               Fear Ray - The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
                          success.
               Slowing Ray - The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an
                             action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
               Enervation Ray - The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
               Telekinetic Ray - If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of
                                 the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The
                                 beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
               Sleep Ray - The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it.
                           This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
               Petrification Ray - The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn.
                                   On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
               Disintegration Ray - If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine
                                    gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of
                                    magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.
               Death Ray - The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.

    - content: This deal has fifty-four cards, each of which has its own name. Forty of them comprise the common deck, which is divided into four suits - swords, coins, stars, and glyphs. Each suit contains cards numbered one
               through nine, plus a tenth card that is called the master of that suit. A card can be referred to by its suit designation or by its name. For instance, the three of glyphs is also known as the healer, and

    background-story: |
      In the battle of Granite Water [any great historical battle in recent time], an old orcish warlock, Gryt Tooth of Mahl, was faced with certain death at the hands of an incoming legion of the Elves of ThistleCloud [Any
      Major Elven City]. He turned to his last resort: an old summoning scroll that was tattered. In desperation facing the encroaching legion, the warlock uttered as many words as he could read from the scroll and performed
      whatever gestures he could make out to cast the spell. Flashes of light and shadow burst from nowhere, colliding in mid air in a cloud of grainy black mist that congealed into the form of a beholder. However, the scroll
      had been damaged badly and the verbal and somatic components thus distorted. The unfortunate result was an undeveloped creature, Khedoldosh, who glanced around with its only working eye, realized the imminent danger, and
      darted off into the hills. Needless to say, Gryt Tooth didn't live much longer.

    personality: |
      Khedoldosh is a weak and malformed creature. However they use a combination of prostetics, magic and disquise in order to pass as a humanoid fortune teller. They don't really have any kind of precognative abilities, but
      use their telepathic powers to read minds and feed their customers the kind of information that they want to hear. It is very intelligent and has the ego to prove it, but due to it's malformation, it's cowardess outwieghs
      it's confidence when it comes to dealing with conflict. When it comes down to it, it's really just trying to survive in a world that it was never meant to be in
