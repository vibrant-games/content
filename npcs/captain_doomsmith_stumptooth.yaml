    background-story: |
      Growing up in a wealthy port-side community, Doomsmith heard many stories about the audacious raids of local pirates. He thus became fascinated with pirates at an early age. His parents paid for yachting lessons for him and encouraged hobby and role playing. When his parents died in a tragic carriage accident, Doomsmith cracked, stole a ship, renamed it "The Skurge" and headed out to see. He used what was left of his parents' monies to recruit a loyal crew and head off to emulate his childhood hero's.  In the time since, he has developed a reputation for ruthlessness if not necessarily efficiency. He is definitely not fond of anyone calling his bluff.
