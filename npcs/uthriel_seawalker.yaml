# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills: 

   - - Water Genasi Abilities:
        - Acid Resistance: You have resistance to acid damage.
        - Amphibious: You can breathe air and water.
        - Swim: You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.
        - Call to the Wave: You know the Shape Water cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Create or Destroy Water spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way 
                            when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

   - - Sorcerer Ability
       - Sorcerer Spellcasting: 7 Sorcery Points, Spell DC 16
          Cantrips: Thunderclap, Shape Water, Booming Blade, Ray of Frost, Lightning Lure
          1st Level: Fog Cloud, Shield, Thunderwave, Magic Missle
          2nd Level: Misty Step, Mind Thrust, Invisibility
          3rd Level: Counterspell, Lightning Bolt, Wall of Water
       - MetaMagic: You gain two of the following Metamagic Options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.
          1: Empowered Spell
          2: Heightened Spell 
       
   - - Storm Sorcery Abilities:
       - Wind Speaker: The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: 
                       Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.
       - Tempestuous Magic: you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to 
                            fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks
       - Heart of the Storm: you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This 
                             eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.
       - Storm Guide: you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you. If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect 
                      as a bonus action. If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the 
                      end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.
       
    special-abilities:
       - Proficiencies: Medicine, Insight, History, Gravekeeping and Embalming Tools
       - Feats: N/A
       
    attacks: |
      1 attack with cutlass or spell attack
    combat-tactics: |
      is always happy to have a go
    special-equipment:
    - Cutlass
    - The Djinn Rummy (Schooner)
    - Tempest Sails: Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)During the day, these sails change color to resemble the current color of the sky. These sails, the mast, and their rigging can’t be damaged by wind of any 
                     strength. As an action while you are aboard the ship, you can treat the wind in the sails as if it is one degree stronger than it is. Additionally, as an action while you are aboard the ship, you can treat 
                     the wind in the sails as if it were blowing in the direction of your choice. (That is, you can change either the speed or the direction.)
    - Ghost-Lantern Bowsprit: Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) An antique iron or brass lantern hangs at the end of this bowsprit. When you light the lantern at night, undead creatures that come within 200 feet of 
                              the bowsprit seem to burn with spectral fire and give off bright light in a 10-foot radius. When your ship would take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a nonmagical weapon, you can use 
                              your reaction to grant the ship resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons until the beginning of your next turn. The ship and all of its crew momentarily seem 
                              ghostly and translucent. Using this power extinguishes the ghost-lantern and prevents it from being relit until the next dusk.

    background-story: |
     The child of an errant Water Djinn and a Sea Elf, Uthriel has sea water in her veins. She grew up in and around the ocean and is more comfortable at sea than on land. In her teens she left her seaside home to attend a 
     Sorcerer's University in the capital. Being that far from the water didn't sit well with her for long, so after just 2 years she returned and began working on ships until she had made enough money to buy her own. The Djinn 
     Rummy is her ship and she runs cargo for customers but her favorite jobs are delivering adventurers to exotic locales.

    #
    personality: |
     Uthriel has worked hard for all that she has, and is confident, often to the point of arrogance. This is becuse she knows how hard she worked and how good she is. She also has an adverturous streak and loves to take on the 
     more odd and difficult jobs.
