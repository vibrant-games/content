    background-story: |
      The child of an errant Water Djinn and a Sea Elf, Uthriel has sea water in her veins. She grew up in and around the ocean and is more comfortable at sea than on land. In her teens she left her seaside home to attend a Sorcerer's University in the capital. Being that far from the water didn't sit well with her for long, so after just 2 years she returned and began working on ships until she had made enough money to buy her own. The Djinn Rummy is her ship and she runs cargo for customers but her favorite jobs are delivering adventurers to exotic locales.
