    background-story: |
      <p>Long escaped from the control of Mind Flayers, Zirrash'ka and his tribe also fled the plane of Limbo [Any non-material plane] and integrated themselves among villages of elves on the rim of known civilization. Quietly keeping to themselves and continuting their gratitude towards their patrons, his tribe thirsted for knowledge of the material plane. They formed a monastic tradition that offered worship and tithing to Jegel, the God of Scribes and Depositioner of the Passed (Or any Deity overlooking the passing of the living to the Dead). They pledged to keep track of all those denizens that once lived, how they lived, and when, how, where, and why they died. Over the decades they developed an advanced library and monastary, training their monks in the value of knowledge, gratitude, courage, and direct action.</p>
