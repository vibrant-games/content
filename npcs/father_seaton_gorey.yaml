# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Changeling Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Shapechanger
    - content: As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but
               not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen,
               and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to
               your true form or until you die.

    - content: True Polymorph
    - title: Sixth Sense
    - content: You can see and speak with spirits. You can see up to 60 ft into the Ethereal Plane while in the Material Plane, and vice versa. You can also gain some benefits after communing with nature for 1 minute.
               When you forage alone, you find twice as much as you normally would.
               You can move stealthily at a normal pace.
               You are aware of recent events in the region, like storms, landslides, etc.
    - title: Spiritual Animal
    - content: You can cast the "Find Familiar" spell as a ritual. Your familiar is always an undead. Your familiar is a spirit, which means it can see 60 ft into the Ethereal Plane while in the Material Plane and 
               vice versa, it can pass through other creatures and objects (it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn on an occupied space), it doesn't have a walking speed, instead, it has a flight speed of 40ft 
               and it can hover (familiars that already have flight speeds keep their value, but lose their walking speed like the others) and it can become invisible with an action.
    - title: Spiritual Possession
    - content: You can use your action to enter a trance and allow a beastly spirit to possess your body, giving you the abilities of the spirit. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you 
               finish a short or long rest. (Optional Rule - the Shaman must have collected the spirit of the animal you wish to channel. to collect you must be aware of the spirit of a creature that meets the 
               requirements and succeed on an animal handling check. When using this rule some monstrosities such as winter wolf may be allowed). Your shaman level determines the spirit that can possess you. 
               You can be possessed by the spirit of a beast with a CR of no more than half your shaman level (rounded down). When you channel you do not gain lair actions or legendary resistances. You can maintain 
               the possession by a number of hours equal to half your shaman level (rounded down). You then end the possession unless you expend another use of this feature.. You can also end the possession with a 
               bonus action in your turn. You automatically end the possession if you fall to 0 hit points, or die. While you are possessed, the following rules apply 
    - content: 1. Some of your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast whose spirit is possessing you. Those being, its Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores, its attacks, its senses and 
                  any other personal features. You don't gain its hit points, AC, or any special types of movement (like flight). Changes in Dex or Con do not effect your AC or HP and only apply for the sake of 
                  checks, saves, and attacks.
    - content: 2. When you use your action to make an attack from your possessing spirit it appears as a spectral apparition of the attack, and while you deal the damage type and dice of the attack, you still use 
                  your weapon on the attack, so, if you use a ranged weapon, like a bow, you can still make any attack from your spirit, like a bite attack. Also, any extra damage, or bonus to attack rolls you gain 
                  from magical weapons still affect your spirit attacks.
    - content: 3. Your spirit's senses overlap yours, so you lose any senses you possess that your spirit doesn't posses with exception to your ethereal sight.
    - content: 4. At level 7 your spirit's attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity against nonmagical damage and attacks. When you reach 11th level, you gain temporary 
                  hit points equal to your shaman level when you become possessed. These hit points last until the end of the possession.
    - title: Shamanistic Ascension
    - content: You choose a Shamanistic Ascension that show how to you use your connection with the spirits; Totem of Elements and Totem of Spirits. You gain additional features from your shamanistic ascension 
               at levels 6, 10, and 14.
    - content: Totem of Spirits
    - content: When you choose the shamanistic ascension of the Totem of Spirits, you wish to deepen your connection to the spirits around you, surround yourself in their presence, and count on them to help you.
    - content: Mortuary Totem - At 3rd Level, you have a totem that serves as a mortuary tablet, where your spirits can reside. You can use your Spirit Possession with a bonus action, rather than your action. Also, once per long
                                rest you can swap your current spirit and be possessed by a different one. This change doesn't affect the duration of the possession (so, if there were only 3 minutes left, your new spirit stays 
                                in you for only 3 minutes). A sudden change like that is vary taxing, you gain 1 level of exhaustion after your possession ends if you used this feature during it.
    - content: Spiritual Medium - At 6th level you have learned a way to strengthen your bond with your spirits. If you have a medium that connects a spirit to its original existence (like bear claws for a bear spirit), you can 
                                  use it to draw out more power from it. You spirit gains a more physical form, the aura around you becoming denser. Your spirit's attacks damage type becomes force damage. And you can spend spell
                                  slots to increase this damage. You gain 1 more dice of damage per level of spell slot used this way (black bear's bite with a 4th level spell slot would deal 5d6 force damage, instead of the 
                                  normal 1d6). This increase in damage lasts until the end of your current turn.
    - content: Spirit Senses - At level 10 you are able to detect the presence of spirits even at great distances. As an action you allow your connection to the ethereal plane guide your senses to these creatures. For 10 minutes
                               you know the location of any creature of the undead type within 100 ft of you. With another action you can increase your focus and learn 2 things
    - content: The exact number of creatures you're sensing.
    - content: You gain a glimpse of their power. The DM gives tells you if the creature is - weak (CR 0 to 1), average (CR 2 to 4), strong (CR 5 to 9), powerful (CR 10 to 15), fearsome (CR 15 to 20), terrifying (CR 21 to 26), 
               monstrous (CR 27 to 30).
    - content: You can use this feature once per short or long rest.
    - content: Spiritual Armor - Starting at level 14 you are able to create a special totem, that is able to condense your possessing spirit into a much denser aura. With a bonus action you activate this form that lasts for 1 
                                 minute. While in this form you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your shaman level times your Wisdom modifier, to a maximum of 5 (if your modifier is higher than 5, treat it as a 5 
                                 when calculating these hit points).
    - content: This feature can be used once. To use it again you must finish a long rest.
    - title: Bridge Between Worlds
    - content: You can, once every long rest, with your strong spiritual power, create a number of totems equal to your wisdom Modifier + 2. These totems can be used by your allies, connecting them with the 
               Ethereal Plane, allowing them to see what you see. The totems can be activated with a bonus action. For 1 hour your allies, who activated their totems, can see into the ethereal plane just like
               you.
    - title: Vengeful Spirits
    - content: Then targeting a creature with a spell that forces them to make a Wisdom saving throw you can choose to loose angry spirits along with the spell. Once per short rest, you can use this feature to make 
               the target make their initial Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed saving throw the spirits torment the target's mind, causing the spell to deal double damage, or last twice as long, your 
               choice if the spell has a duration and causes damage. On a success, nothing happens.
    - title: Grand Shaman
    - content: You can use your Spirit Possession an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your shaman spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and 
               aren’t consumed by a spell.

    background-story: |
      Grey Crow was once the shaman of her primitive tribe. During one of her journey's into the astral plane to speak with the spirits, she was touched by the Forbidden Gods. Their touch corrupted her spirit and her mind, 
      leaving her their emmisary, walking the earth and sewing chaos in her wake. She returned to her body a corrupted being, and immediately proceeded to slaughter her tribe. Since then, she has walked the earth, doing the
      bidding of her masters, preparing the world for their return. Somewhere along the line, she came into posession of a silver dagger forged by the Githyanki and capale of severing astral cords.

    personality: |
      Grey Crow is an exceedingly cunning liar and trickster. She is completely mad and derranged, but hides it well when it suits her needs. Her favorite game is to approach strangers out of the night, joining their campfire
      as an elderly traveller on her own seeking shelter and companionship. She will then turn their secrets against them and use them to steer adventureres from their path. She likes to play tricks and jokes that cause as much 
      choas as possible and uses her shapeshifting abilities to cause as much confusion and mistrust as possible with parties. She will rarely venture into large towns or cities, prefering to stick to the wilds. One of her
      favorite tricks is convincing adventureres to travel with her to the Astral Plane with her, then using her silver dagger to sever their astral cord, leaving her victims dead and unrevivable.
