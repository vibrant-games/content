# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Turn Undead
    - content: As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving 
               throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. 
               It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.    
    - title: Destroy Undead
    - content: Starting at 5th Level, when an Undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against Your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed.    
    - title: Divine Intervention
    - content: Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll 
               percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be 
               appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, 
               no roll required.   
  - title: Blood Hunter Abilities
  - abilities:
    - title: Hunters Bane
    - content: You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them. The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to 
               control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. 
    - title: Hemocraft save DC
    - content: 22
    - title: Blood Maledict 
    - content: you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one Blood Curse of your choice. You learn one 
               additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. When you use your Blood Maledict, 
               you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft 
               die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are 
               immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse. You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times 
               between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

    - title: Blood Curses

    - title: Figthing Style
    - content: Two-Weapon Fighting
    - title: Crimson Rite
    - content: You learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Crimson Rites list to learn. As a bonus action, you activate a crimson rite on a 
               single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite,
               you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage 
               of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active 
               rite at a time. You learn an additional Crimson Rite of your choice at 7th level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14th level.
    - title: Crimson Rites Known
    - content: 3
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
    - title: Brand of Castigation
    - content: Whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded 
               creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier 
               (minimum of 1 damage). Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to 
               half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
    - title: Grim Psychometry
    - content: You have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past 
               surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and
               sometimes conveys visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.	
    - title: Dark Augmentation
    - content: Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
    - title: Brand of Tethering
    - content: The psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature 
               branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane 
               shift fails.
    - title: Hardened Soul
    - content: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.
    - title: Sanguine Mastery
    - content: Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with 
               a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.

    - title: Bloodletting Focus
    - content: Whenever blood clerics deal damage to creatures with blood with any spell of 1st level or higher (including the weapon attacks of spiritual weapon[10]), they deal extra necrotic damage by drawing blood from the 
               wounds.
    - title: Channel Divinity - Crimson Bond
    - content: As an action, blood clerics can focus on a sample of a creature's blood to learn that creature's approximate distance from the cleric and in which direction, and the creature's general state of health (based on 
               percentage of hit points), as long as the creature is within 10 miles. The cleric can maintain concentration on this bond for up to one hour.
               While the bond is maintained, the cleric can spend an action to force the target creature to make a Constitution saving throw. If they succeed, the bond ends. If the creature fails, the cleric can see through the 
               target's eyes or hear through the target's ears instead of the cleric's own for a number of rounds equal to the cleric's Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 round), after which the bond ends. Regardless of the outcome

      Grey Crow was once the shaman of her primitive tribe. During one of her journey's into the astral plane to speak with the spirits, she was touched by the Forbidden Gods. Their touch corrupted her spirit and her mind, 
      leaving her their emmisary, walking the earth and sewing chaos in her wake. She returned to her body a corrupted being, and immediately proceeded to slaughter her tribe. Since then, she has walked the earth, doing the
      bidding of her masters, preparing the world for their return. Somewhere along the line, she came into posession of a silver dagger forged by the Githyanki and capale of severing astral cords.

    personality: |
      Grey Crow is an exceedingly cunning liar and trickster. She is completely mad and derranged, but hides it well when it suits her needs. Her favorite game is to approach strangers out of the night, joining their campfire
      as an elderly traveller on her own seeking shelter and companionship. She will then turn their secrets against them and use them to steer adventureres from their path. She likes to play tricks and jokes that cause as much 
      choas as possible and uses her shapeshifting abilities to cause as much confusion and mistrust as possible with parties. She will rarely venture into large towns or cities, prefering to stick to the wilds. One of her
      favorite tricks is convincing adventureres to travel with her to the Astral Plane with her, then using her silver dagger to sever their astral cord, leaving her victims dead and unrevivable.
