# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

       - Uncanny Dodge: When an attacker she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her Reaction to halve the damage 
       - Evasion: When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail
       - Reliable Talent: Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your Proficiency Bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
       - Blindsense: if you are able to hear, you are aware of the Location of any hidden or Invisible creature within 10 feet of you
       - Slippery Mind: You gain proficiency in Wisdom Saving Throws

   - - Inquisitive Abilities:
       - Ear for Deciet: you develop a keen ear for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8 
       - Eye for Detail:  you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues

       - Steady Eye: you gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn
       - Enerring Eye: your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you,
                       provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature. You can use this feature a number of times
                       equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

    background-story: |
     Methuselah "Thuse" Cade may be one of the greatest investigators in the world. She began her career as military police, learning investigation and interrogation techniques in addition to her martial training. After her
     military obligation was done, she left and became a Watch Detective. She quickly established a reputation as one of the most thorough and effective investigators the ranks had ever seen, despite not necessarily doing
     so "by the book". Her unorthodox method ruffled many a feather in the ranks of the guard and city watch, as did her willingness to investigate any case till its conclusion. Even if that conclusion was her superiors, city
     or church officials. One such investigation involving several missing children pointed to a local temple and she was murdered for her trouble. Thuse is a Revenant. Returning from the dead with a mandate to find and save
     missing children, and to hunt and reek vengeance on child killers. In the meantime, she takes any cases she finds interesting to pass the time and pay the bills.

    #
    personality: |
      Methuselah Cade, or Thuse to her friends (she doesn't have any friends), is a brilliant and intense detective. She continues to research and develop the latest in forensic techniques to help in her investigations.
      Any case she takes, she will doggedly persue it to its end regardless of the cost. She is tired. As a revenant, she has been around for a comparatively long time for a human, and the years are beginning to wear away at her.
      Despite the fact that she no longer ages, you can see the years deep in her eyes. Thuse is not the most personable of people, and at her age, most of the people she ever considered friends are long gone for one reason or
      another. She is however, very well connected and a lot of people owe her favors. Her mandate as a revenant, does give her a sepcial kind of bond with children, and if she is working on a case involving kids, she is
      especially dogged and obsessive. Thuse is very witty and very jaded and her sarcasm has a bit of a bite. She is also a keen negotiator and will only take jobs that pay especially well or the genuinely spark her interest.
      Unlike many revenants, she does not have one specific creature or individual involved with her goal, just a general goal to protect or revenge lost children, as such, she has no idea what will be the case that will
      eventually be her last, but at this point, she hopes it's soon.
