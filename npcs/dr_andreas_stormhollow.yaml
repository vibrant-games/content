# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - abilities:
    - title: Medical Training
    - content: Due to your meticulous study into the healing arts you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for Medicine checks. In addition your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
               Medicine checks that you make. 
    - title: Doctors Bag
    - content: You gain access to a number of special supplies due to your medical training. These supplies include things like bandages, syringes, medicinal powders, and healing salves. You keep these in a storage
               container of your choice such as a bag, a series of pouches, or even a trunk. As long as you have access to your Doctor's Bag you may use an action to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without
               needing to make a Medicine check.
    - title: First Aid
    - content: You can apply basic first aid to an adjacent creature you can touch. As a bonus action you heal the target for 1d4 hit points. This increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th
               level (4d4). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier + 1. You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
    - title: Second Opinion
    - content: You have become accustomed not only to combat, but to coordinating with other healers. Whenever an ally within 20ft of you uses a healing ability, spell, or item, you can use your reaction to increase
               the amount healed to a single target by half, rounded up. Your ally must be able to see or hear you.
    - title: Patch Up
    - content: You have learned that there is always another fight around the corner, and it's best to be ready for it. Select up to 6 willing creatures that you can touch. You spend the next 10 minutes quickly stitching up
               any open wounds and applying painkillers where needed, whatever it takes to get them to the next battle. This cures them of any non-magical ailments and restores a number of hit points equal to half of their
               maximum rounded up. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier divided by two (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
    - title: Diagnosis
    - content: You have learned to treat hostile scenarios as just another day at the office. As an action you study a living creature and gain vital insight towards its physical state. You learn one of the targets
               following statistics - Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, Highest Saving Throw, Lowest Saving Throw, or whether or not the creature is below half its health. You can use this
               feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
    - title: Paramedic
    - content: You have become experienced at reaching the injured without taking damage. When you use your action to disengage you may also double your movement speed until the end of your turn
    - title: Vaccination
    - content: You have spent countless hours attempting to aid those suffering from disease and have developed a number of treatments. As an action you can cure a target of a single disease afflicting them. Alternatively,
               you can inoculate a target against disease for the next 24 hours. In addition, due to exposure from numerous patients the doctor gains immunity to all disease.
    - title: Vitality Boost
    - content: You have become an expert at healing at a moment’s notice. As an bonus action you can heal an adjacent creature you can touch for 4d6 hit points. This increases by 2d6 when you reach 15th level (6d6).
               You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier + 1. You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
    - title: Reanimation
    - content: You provide life saving aid to a creature that has died within the last 10 minutes and return them to life. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This procedure can't return to life a creature that
               has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. You cannot use this feature again until you have completed a short rest.
    - title: Experianced Healer
    - content: You are unlikely to fail at common medical tasks. Whenever you make a Medicine check you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
    - title: Sedate
    - content: You have managed to create sedatives using standard supplies. As an action you can inject a willing creature with a sedative that will cause them to go unconscious for 1d4 hours. You can also attempt to inject
               an unwilling creature for the same effect. An unwilling target must be below one quarter of its maximum hit points for this ability to take effect. They must then succeed a Constitution saving throw or
               immediately fall unconscious for 1d4 hours.
    - title: Practiced Hands
    - content: You have performed the same procedures countless times. Whenenever you use a healing ability, item, or other effect that involves a die roll you can add an additional healing die of the same type to the
               end result, even if the result would otherwise be maximized.

    - content: At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith’s tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.
    - title: Prosthesis Expertise
    - content: At 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with your power, creating a permanent magical item that replaces a lost limb—a hand, arm, foot, leg, or similar body 
               part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. The wearer can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against the wearer’s will. It detaches if the 
               wearer dies.
    - title: Battlefist
    - content: At 3rd level you replace one of your arms with a battlefist, a magical prosthetic you created. Your battlefist is a simple melee weapon, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. While 
               your battlefist is a magical weapon, it can be infused as if it were a nonmagical weapon.
               When you attack with your battlefist, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the attack roll. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength or Intelligence 
               modifier. At 9th level, the damage dealt by your battlefist increases to 2d10 + your Strength or Intelligence modifier.
               Additionally, you can choose one of the following weapon properties to add to your battlefist - finesse, thrown (range 20/60), or reach. When you finish a long rest, you can replace this property with a different

    background-story: |
      Dr. Andreas Stormhollow is a world renouned surgeon and a pioneer in both the science and magic of amputation and prosthetics. Starting his career as a young combat medic he quickly gained experience in and an affinity
      for quick and skillful amputation. After the wars of his youth, he dedicated himself to helping veterans and developed important breakthroughs in the science and spellcraft of creating prosthetic limbs. His proclivity and 
      renoun attracted the attention of Oswald Vardklemp, who invited him to become a founding member of the Collegium Imaginata, which he greatfully accepted. After joiningn the Collegium, he met and began a relationship 
      with remouned chemist Robert Holmestar, they became lovers and research partners until Robert was kidnapped by a cult and sacrificed to their patron god. Arriving to late to save his love, Andreas collected his remains,
      brought them back to his lab and with the help of Thadeus Periwinkle and Ulther Hapwath, they attempted to rebuild and revive Robert. Using a mix of chemistry, biology, mechanics, artificer's magic and a healthy dose of
      forbidden Necromancy, they succeeded in form only, creating a mindless monster in a rough approximation of his former love. Andreas took all of the heat for the failed attempt and the use of necromancy, covering for Ulther
      and Thadeus, and was excommunicated from the Collegium. Seperated from his friends, colleagues and lover, Andreas was left to his own devices, but still had his money, influence and renoun in the medical community. He struck
      out in his own practice, began building his own collective to rival the Collegium and mass producing affordable prosthetic limbs. All the while, he still longed for the return of his love and delved deeper and deeper into 
      the study of Necromancy and it's practical medical sibling; Stitching, trying to find a way to bring him back.

    personality: |
      Dr. Andreas Stormhollow is a tall and lithe tiefling with small pointed horns. His skin is the reddish color of a bad sunburn, he has golden colored eyes and jet black hair with clight bits of salt and pepper at the edges.
      He has short, well maintained facial hair and is always impeccably dressed under his lab coat. Andreas always maintains an exceptionally professional and stable demeanor while in public. He is a brilliant and well respected
      doctor, scientist and buisiness ownder in the eyes of the public and his staff. In private however, Dr. Stormhollow has cracked. The loss of his love and station within the Collegium, and his foray into necromancy, has left
      Andreas more than a little on the mad side. He has embraced his devil heritage and delved deep into the studies of necromancy and stitching. He has become obsessed with the undead and unlife. His private experiments have
      gotten more and more extreme as he searches for a way to restore his love, Robert, to his former self. With the exception of Thadeus Periwinkle and Ulther Hapwath, who he is periodically in contact with, and helps their 
      research when he can, he considers the rest of the Collegium and Oswald Vardklemp in particular to be his enemies and rivals for refusing to help him recover Robert and for keeping Robert's monsterous reborn form captive.
