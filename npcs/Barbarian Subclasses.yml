   - - Path of the Beast Abilities:
       - Form of the Beast: when you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your 
                            Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal. You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage;
                            Bite: Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you 
                                  regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.
                            Claws: Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the 
                                   Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.
                            Tail: You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use 
                                  your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
       - Bestial Soul: the feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You 
                       can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest;
                       - You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
                       - You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
                       - When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.
       - Infectious Fury: when you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
                          Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice);
                          - The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
                          - Target takes 2d12 psychic damage.
                          You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Call the Hunt: the beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing 
                        creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends
                        the chosen creatures can use the following benefit once on each of their turns; when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to 
                        the damage equal to the number rolled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                        
                        
                        
   - - Path of the Berserk Abilities:
       - Fenzy: can go into a Frenzy when he rages. If he does so, for the Duration of his rage he can make a single melee weapon Attack as a Bonus Action on each of his turns after this one. When his rage ends, 
                he suffer one level of Exhaustion
       - Mindless Rage: you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.
       - Intimidating Presence: you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must 
                                succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your 
                                action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet 
                                away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
       - Retaliation: when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
       
       
       
   - - Path of the Ancestral Guardian:
         - Ancestral Protectors: spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until 
                                 the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has 
                                 resistance to the damage of the target’s attacks.
         - Spirit Shield: the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to 
                          reduce that damage by 2d6. When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more; by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.
         - Consult the Spirits: you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a 
                                spherical sensor, this use of Clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either spell
                                in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
         - Vengeful Ancestors: your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage that your Spirit Shield 
                               prevents.
