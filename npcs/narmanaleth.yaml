# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:

   - - Kalashtar Abilities:
       - Dual Mind: When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. You can use this trait immediately before or after you roll, but before any of the roll's effects occur.
       - Mental Discipline: You have resistance to psychic damage
       - Mind Link: You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be
                    able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself. As a bonus action when you’re speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you
                    until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and be able to see you.
       - Psychic Glamour: Choose one of the following skills - Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion. You have advantage on all ability checks you make with that skill
       - Severed from Dreams: Kalashtar sleep, but they don’t connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are
                              immune to magical spells and effects that require you to dream, like the Dream spell, but not to spells and effects that put you to sleep, like the Sleep spell

   - - Shaman Abilities:
       - Totem Spirit: Raven
       - Ironwood Skin: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit
       - Natural Explorer: Favored Terrain - Forest. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you are proficient.
                           While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits - 
                           - Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
                           - Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
                           - Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
                           - If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
                           - When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
                           - While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area
       - Spiritual Magic: Spell DC 20
         Cantrips: Mage Hand, Mold Earth, Shape Water, Toll the Dead, Infestation
         1st Level: Bane, Bless, Purify Food and Water, Speak With Animals
         2nd Level: Augury, Shatter, Spiritual Weapon
         3rd Level: Speak with Dead, Spiritual Guardians, Fireball
         4th Level: Blight, Polymorph, Wall of Fire
         5th Level: Awaken, Commune with Nature, Modify Memory, Insect Plague
         6th Level: Chain Lightning, Disintegrate
         7th Level: Plane Shift, Resurrection
         8th Level: Control Weather
         9th Level: Storm of Vengeance
       - Spirit Sight: you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see,
                       such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated
       - Primal Protector: you can connect with animal spirits and improve the demeanor of a creature with the beast type that you can see. Using your totem, you can use your action to attempt to make a target creature
                           indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. Each beast creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
                           it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate. You are able to perform this twice per short or long rest
       - Spiritual Connection: your spiritual connection with your Spirit World grows and it blesses you with mental fortitude. A spiritual aura surrounds you, and grants you and any allies within 10 feet advantage on
                               Constitution and Wisdom saving throws 
       - Bounty of Life: you can choose to drain the life force from a creature. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw versus your spell save DC; on a failed save, you
                         gain temporary hit points equal to the damage caused to the creature. You can use this ability once per round
       - Spiritual Whisper: Psychic Scream - you are bestowed a magical secret as if it were a whisper into your mind. Choose one 9th- level spell from the Shaman spell list as this whisper. You can cast your secret spell once
                            without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. You regain all uses of your Spiritual whisper when you finish a long rest. 
       - Eternal Favor: the primal magic that you wield requires you to age very slowly. In order to complete tasks in the natural world, every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year
       - Vengeful Spirits: when targeting a creature with a spell that forces them to make a Wisdom saving throw you can choose to loose angry spirits along with the spell. Once per short rest, you can use this feature to make
                           the target make their initial Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed saving throw the spirits torment the target's mind, causing the spell to deal double damage, or last twice as long, your
                           choice if the spell has a duration and causes damage. On a success, nothing happens
       - Spiritual Warrior: you embody the spiritual power of the world and it infuses you with vigor and insight. Your Wisdom score increases by 4. Your maximum for this score is now 24
       
   - - Path of the Spirit Abilities:
       - Spiritual Guide:  you are bestowed a spirit guide to help you progress further. The spirit guide takes on the incorporeal form of your totem spirit. Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your Spirit Guide
                           appears by your side. The Spirit Guide is the embodiment of the Spirit World for you. It cannot be seen by anyone else by non-magical means, but it can see and hear others as you would. The Spirit
                           guide communicates and interacts with the shaman as a conscious being. The spirit guide grants the shaman advantage to initiative rolls, can’t be surprised while conscious, and other creatures don’t
                           gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.
       - Ghost Touch: any weapon that you touch deals damage normally against any incorporeal creature regardless of its resistance to that damage type. This feature lasts as long as the shaman holds the weapon. The shaman also
                      gains resistance to melee attacks from incorporeal creatures e.g. ghosts, shadows, wraiths, will-o’-wisp, specters
       - Spiritual Focus: you can give the spirit guide the task of concentrating on a spell or spell-like ability that is maintained through concentration. The shaman can act normally while his spirit guide concentrates on the
                          spell. If the shaman casts another spell that requires concentration, then the first spell effect ends and the second spell begins. The shaman can choose the spirit guide to concentrate on any
                          subsequent spells cast. A spirit guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. A spirit guide does not have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such as the shaman taking damage. The
                          spirit guide is not present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact. If the shaman falls unconscious or dies, then the spirit guide stops concentrating on the spell, and the spell’s effect ends.
       - Spirit Journey: a spirit shaman knows how to vanish bodily into the Spirit World. As an Action, a shaman can become incorporeal and move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes
                         1d10 force damage if he ends his turn inside an object. While incorporeal, the shaman does not invoke attacks of opportunity. Outside of combat, the shaman can spend time in prayer and meditation to
                         commune directly with other spirits in the Spirit World to attempt receive information concerning their current quest. The shaman can ask three questions that can be answers with a yes or no. While in
                         meditation, the shaman’s soul is in the Spirit World, and cannot communicate with others in the Natural world
                         
   - - Psionic Abiities:
       - Wild Talent: You also harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die
                      Psionic Talent Die = d12
                      - Psionic Talent Options:
                        - Psi-Boosted Ability: When you make an ability check with the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before
                                               or after rolling the d20, but before you know whether the check succeeded or failed.
                        - Psi-Guided Strike: Once on each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll that uses the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die after you make the damage roll and then
                                             replace one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the Psionic Talent die.
                        - Changing the Dies Size: If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if
                                                  the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic
                                                  Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a
                                                  d4, the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels, the starting size of your

                                 Tree Form: You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter
                                            trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic if targeted by Detect Magic. While
                                            touching the tree and using another action to speak its Command, word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.

       - Holy Symbol of Ravenkind: The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful. It predates the establishment of any church. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named
                                   Lugdana by a giant raven—or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept
                                   and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing. The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center. The holy symbol has 10 charges for the
                                   following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.

                                                  must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself.
                                   Turn Undead: If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have
                                                disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.
                                   Sunlight: As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight
                                             and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).

    background-story: |
     After coming of age in Adar and seeing the threats posed by the Dreaming Dark and the Riedra, Narmanaleth fled out into the world to hide, fight back and follow the path of a shaman. Using his Quori spirit to help him
     connect with other spirits of other realms, he became very adept and after years of practicing, very powerful in his chosen path. He speaks with and for the spirits. In addition to using his power to combat the forces of
     the Dreaming Dark on the astral plane, he will also seek out heroes and adventurers to help them find their path at the spirit's behest. He is very old and very tired now, his battle is almost done and he's looking for
     those who would follow in his footsteps to impart his knowledge. Like most of his kind, he has bouts of madness caused by his twin spirit, but they are much fewer and further between as he's gotten older.

    personality: |
      Narmanaleth is a wise and kind mentor. He has been a warrior for a long time and now he is tired and just wants to pass on his knowledge to the next generation of warriors. His twin spirit sometimes gives the appearance of
      madness, but he is much better at maintining his composure then he was as a young man. He is still more than capable of defending himself, but mostly concentrates on battles in the astral plain, as his physical body is not
      what it used to be.
