    background-story: |
      <p>Having been trained as a mason as a young dwarf, at just over 300 years old, Dewarn is about as good at his job as they come. He's fast, skilled and thorough as a mason with a masters eye for detail.  He is however, also a heavy drinker and that has taken it's toll on his dexterity has slowly begun to fade as he's advanced in age. He is a true master of his craft, but these days he's better off teaching the youngsters than doing the work himself.</P>
