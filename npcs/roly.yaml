# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     A young and adventurous Minotaur engaged in a brutal and near life-ending battle with the clerics of Hamuun [Any deity, really] in defense of his prized possession - a holy relic the Minotaur had uncovered from cave
     fissures. The clerics had traveled a great distance in search of the relic and most certainly were not going to forego finding it in the caves as they had performed extensive research to locate it. They did not expect a
     guardian minotaur. The missionaries did not wish to slay the beast as they discovered it had been charmed to guard the relic. In the battle, the Minotaur was clubbed hard to the skull in an attempt to subdue them.
     The Minotaur lost consciousness and the clerics uncovered the relic and returned it, along with the Minotaur, to their temple district. The Minotaur came to consciousness in the presence of one of the healing
     priestesses of the Order - a beautiful gnomish woman. "You will heal in time," she said gently. The Minotaur was overwhelmed with her beauty and overwhelmed with her gentle touch. The charm spell coupled with
     serious head trauma loosened the Minotaur from his memories and sense of identity. They internalized their caretaker and formed a new version of themself in their head - that of a helpful gnome. Once fully recovered, and
     properly guided to an identifiable name, Roly, by their caretaker, they made their way about town looking to help others. The local innkeeper sympathized with Roly and offered them the position of Porter for the Inn.
     Roly's incredible service gained notoriety and local merchants and guilds began to enlist their services.

    personality: |
     Roly as they are called these days, is a genuine delight. They love to be helpful and works hard to be an asset to all they meets. It is unclear as to how much of they're actual personality is left in there and how much is
     a new construct, invented after his head injuries. It is also unclear if their old memories will ever return and what will happen if they ever do
