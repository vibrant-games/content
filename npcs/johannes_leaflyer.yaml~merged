    background-story: |
      <P>Johannes grew up in a middle class family and never really had to work hard for anything. He spent a fair amount of time in pubs and taverns as a teen and eventually just fell into working in them. </p><p>His elf side gives him a natural dexterity for flare bartending and showmanship. As handsome and skilled as he is, he's become a very popular attraction at the local bars and makes a very good living for a drink slinger.</p><p> He loves being an attraction and leans into showing off, and the ladies eat it up. He is smart enough to pay attention to what is going on around him and can be a valuable source of information if he can be briefly pulled away from his entertaining the bar crowd.</p>

# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Johannes grew up in a middle class family and never really had to work hard for anything. He spent a fair amount of time in pubs and taverns as a teen and eventually just fell into working in them. His elf side gives him
      a natural dexterity for flare bartending and showmanship. As handsome and skilled as he is, he's become a very popular attraction at the local bars and makes a very good living for a drink slinger. He loves being an
      attraction and leans into showing off, and the ladies eat it up. He is smart enough to pay attention to what is going on around him and can be a valuable source of information if he can be briefly pulled away from his
      entertaining the bar crowd

    personality: |
      Johannes is a creature of pure ego. He is lazy and entitled and will persue anything that feeds his ego. His personality is superficial and could deffinitely be considered in the realm of shallow and vacuous
