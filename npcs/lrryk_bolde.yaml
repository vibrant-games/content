# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Lrryk is a former bandit leader and co-conspirator in a region-wide organized crime syndicate. His renown as "Tarback" is prolific. Yet his capture and consequent imprisonment redirected his values and life-goals. In the
      harsh prisons of Eldon's Passing [any remote town largely designed around its prison] Lrryk was faced with many of the ne'er-do-wells he had mistreated on the outs. Forced to make a moral and psychic shift, he befriended
      some common correction guards and proved to them that his transformation was genuine. It was these corrections officers that taught him the use of the glaive and the value of subduing his enemies rather than murdering
      them. When Lrryk was done his time he sought out a small fortune he hid in an abandoned mining camp. With these funds he commissioned the building of his inn and tavern, "the Roost", where he now lives a life of stability
      with very little tolerance for crime or aspects of 'the Life'.

    #
    personality: |
      Lrryk is a man full of regrets. He has honestly turned over a new leaf from his previous criminal life. He is cautious and careful not to allow his old life to creep back into his new life and does his best to keep the
      "unsavory types" out of his new establishment. He is a competent in his new life as he was in his old and runs a tight ship at his inn
