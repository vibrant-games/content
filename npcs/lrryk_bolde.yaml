    background-story: |
      <p>Lrryk is a former bandit leader and co-conspirator in a region-wide organized crime syndicate. His renown as "Tarback" is prolific. Yet his capture and consequent imprisonment redirected his values and life-goals</p><p>In the harsh prisons of Eldon's Passing [any remote town largely designed <i>around</i> its prison] Lrryk was faced with many of the ne'er-do-wells he had mistreated on the outs. Forced to make a moral and psychic shift, he befriended some common correction guards and proved to them that his transformation was genuine. It was these corrections officers that taught him the use of the glaive and the value of subduing his enemies rather than murdering them.</p><p>When Lrryk was done his time he sought out a small fortune he hid in an abandoned mining camp. With these funds he commissioned the building of his inn and tavern, "the Roost", where he now lives a life of stability with very little tolerance for crime or aspects of 'the Life'.</p>
