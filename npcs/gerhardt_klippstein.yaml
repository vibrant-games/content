# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               choice.
    - title: Arcane Armor
    - contnet: Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand. 
    - content: You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor;
    - content: If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
    - content: You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
    - content: The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any 
               missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
    - content: The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.
    - title: Armor Model
    - content: You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models; Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it. Each model includes
               a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. You can change the armor's model whenever you 
               finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.
    - title: Guardian
    - content: You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features
    - title: Thunder Gauntlets
    - content: Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has 
               disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.
    - title: Defensive Field
    - content: As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you 
               doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Infiltrator
    - content: You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features;
    - content: Lightning Launcher - A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, 
                                    and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.
    - content: Powered Steps - Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
    - content: Dampening Field - You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.  
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Armor Modifications
    - content: You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature; armor (the chest piece), 
               boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's model with the Armor Model feature. In 
               addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.
    - title: Perfected Armor
    - content: Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.
    - content: Guardian - When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell 
                          save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of 
                          this reaction. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
    - content: Infiltrator - Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot 
                             radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, 
                             the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

               It has a speed of 80 feet and can take 150HP damage before it stops running.

      So when he was approached by Oswald with an offer of unlimited funding, people to work with and a compound to continue his work, he jumped at the chance. Working with the Collegium Imaginata has been a 
      dream come true for him. As an efficient researcher and administrator, Gerhardt was an easy choice for Oswald to make his second in command. Gerhardt likes Oswald, but has always believed that he is the
      smarter of the two men and that he should be in charge of the Collegium

      Gerhardt Klippstein is a tall, thin, light blue-skinned, four-armed Vedalken man. He stands at about 6'6" tall. He is comepletely hairless with a broad, flat nose and light violet eyes. He is cold, severe
      and intense. He is deeply devoted to arcane science and to his work. He firmly believes that the world should be orderly and efficient and that his work will help it become that way. He does not particularly
      like people and rarely gets along with others but does appreciate scientific and arcane input from reputable sources. In typically dispassionate and detached Vedalken manner, he views the world through a
      sterile lens and does his best strive for what he views as perfections and limitless efficiency.
