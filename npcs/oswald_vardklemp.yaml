# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Steel Defender
    - content: Your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which
               uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics. In combat, the defender
               shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a 
               bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, 
               not just Dodge. If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 
               feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel 
               defender if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

    - content: Intimidate - It is an imposing sight and all those seeing it for the first time must make a DC 12 Wisdom save or become firghtened for 1 round

    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Arcane Jolt
    - content: You've learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the 
               strike to create one of the following effects
               The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
               Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.
               You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Improved Defender
    - content: Your Arcane Jolt and steel defender become more powerful
               The extra damage and the healing of your Arcane Jolt both increase to 4d6.
               Your steel defender gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
               Whenever your steel defender uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.

    background-story: |
      Oswald Vardklemp is the founder, leader and head designer of the Collegium Imaginata, a group of loosley aligned artificers, mages and scientists dedicated to the technological advancement of society. Oswald had 
      gradually made his name as an artificer, building his reputation throughout the land as great and dedicated, if slightly reckless, inventor. One day Oswald was visited in his labratory by a strange traveller. That 
      visitor was Ral Zarek, Guildmaster of the Izzet League from the plane of Ravnica, and renouned Planeswalker. Master Zarek spoke to Oswald and regaled him with tales of the Izzet and their great world-altering scientific 
      discoveries back on Ravnica and convinced Oswald of the merits of creating a consortium of ideas and opening a permanent channel of communication with the Izzet League. Oswald then set about, with some financial aid 
      from the Izzet, bulding Collegium compounds in most major cities throughout the world and inviting prominent artificers, mages and scientists to join, learn, work and share. He continues to function as the leader and 
      spokesman for the Collegium while continuing his own research and development.

    personality: |
      Oswald Vardklemp is short, even for a rock gnome. He is also quite overweight, about as wide as he is tall. He is bald with a big bushy beard. He wears rumpled clothing and a long (for him) lab coat and his 
      Artificer's Glasses. Oswald is a brilliant mind and artificer as well as a competent and attention commanding leader. He is driven and devoted, but is known to be gruff and easily infuriated when his work is 
      interupted. He is also known to be fairly reckless when testing his new devices and contraptions and now and again manages to do some significant damage to Collegium compounds and the surrounding cities with 
      out of control inventions. He has kept the indentity of of the Collegium's benefactors and their exraplanar origins to himself, but meets quarterly at secret location with Ral Zarek to maintain communication 
      channels.
