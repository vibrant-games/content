    background-story: |
      Like most of his kind Goronk finds his identity by proving his martial prowess. Those who don't or won't fight are weak in his eyes. He doesn't trust magic users, he sees it as a crutch and believes that martial weapons are the only way to go. He's fairly easy to barter with for his services as hes more concerned with building his reputation as a fighter than he is with the money side of things. He's completely unconcerned with the moral side of his profession and will just as happily work with raiders raiding a village as he would fighting bad guys, as long as he gets to fight
