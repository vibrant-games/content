# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature. You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 
               1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table. 
               Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest. 
               When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest; two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir 
               requires its own flask.
               d6     Effect
                1     Healing - The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence Modifier

                3     Resilience - The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes.
                4     Boldness - The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute.
                5     Flight - The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes.
                6     Transformation - The drinker's body is transformed as if by the Alter Self spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes.
    - title: Alchemical Savant
    - content: You've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, 
               you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier 
               (minimum of +1). 
    - title: Restorative Reagents
    - content: You can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works
               Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
               You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times 
               equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Chemical Mastery
    - content: You have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments
               You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.
               You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the 
               spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

    background-story: |
      The Monster is The Collegium Imaginata's dirty little secret. Roderick Holmestar was a brilliant chemist and alchemist and a founding member and board member of the Collegium, personally recruited by Oswald Vardklemp 
      for his brilliant mind. He was kidnapped and tortured by a cult in an attempt to force him to create an immortality elixir for them. Failing to do so, they chose to sacrifice him to their patron gods.  Oswald and the 
      Collegium attempted to track them down but arrived too late to save him. After dispatching the members of the cult, the Collegium collected Rodericks remains, took them back to their compound and rebuilt him. Using their 
      collective knowledge of chemistry, biology, mechanics and artificer's magic, they managed to restore him to a semblance of life. Unfortunately, as much machine as he is undead man, his brilliant mind seems to be all 
      but gone. He can't speak but has an animal ferocity and strength. The Collegium has tried to keep The Monster locked up, safe, but comfortable until they can figure out how to bring their friend back. But The Monster 
      has escaped!

      The Monster is a huge, muscled, lumbering beast, a patchwork of flesh and metal in humanoid shape. He wore a robe after the surgery that saved their life, but that has since become tattered and soiled. The Monster looks 
      somewhat like Roderick did in life, but more of a grim parody and considerably larger. Unbeknownst to the other members of the Collegium, Roderick's mind is still mostly intact inside The Monster, but he can't seem to find 
      his way back to the surface through the rage and confusion that is controlling the body. He does not remember who or what he was was before, but his intelect and knowledge is still there buried deep. It was Roderick's 
      influence that encouraged The Monster to escape his comfortable prison in an effort to get out and find a way to bring himself back into control.
