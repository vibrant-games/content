# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Lizardfolk Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Bite
    - content: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an 
               unarmed strike.
    - title: Cunning Artisan
    - content: As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items; a shield, a 
               club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools.

    background-story: |
     The swamp community that Slizz'nek lives in has become an important port city at a river delta  bordering a large lake between nation-states, much to the chagrin of the local lizardfolk population. But as always, his tribe
     adapts. Taking a job on the docks to show the "softskins" what a "real male" is.  He's gruff, uncultured and temperamental, but he works hard and makes enough to afford all of the food that he can eat. Not being terribly
     bright and generally having a disrespect the government that has overtaken his lands, he can easily be bribed to help out with smuggling operations at the docks

    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Slizz'nek isn't the smartest guy on the docks, but he's not afraid of a day's hard labor. He's gruf and hot-tempered and very much a traditionalist of lizardfolk culture. He doesn't like outsiders and thinks of other races
     as softskins of fleshbags and sees them as a potential meal somewhere down the line. But in the meantime, he's a survivor, so he keeps his head down and does his job. Now and then, he'll make a little extra cash to turn a
     blind eye to some of the illegal activities that go on down at the docks
