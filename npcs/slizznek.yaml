    background-story: |
      The swamp community that Slizz'nek lives in has become an important port city at a river delta  bordering a large lake between nation-states, much to the chagrin of the local lizardfolk population. But as always, his tribe adapts. Taking a job on the docks to show the "softskins" what a "real male" is.  He's gruff, uncultured and temperamental, but he works hard and makes enough to afford all of the food that he can eat. Not being terribly bright and generally having a disrespect the government that has overtaken his lands, he can easily be bribed to help out with smuggling operations at the docks
