# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Mordechai Dumas is the youngest son of Anastasia and the record keeper and lore master of the family. After his fathers untimely murder and his mothers transformation, Mordechai retreated into the safety of his books. 
      He grew to become an accomplished scholar and as his knowledge grew, so did his magical prowess. His studies lead him deep into the history of the Dumas family and His mothers family as well. 
      He has uncovered and recorded many secrets unknown to the rest of the family. While most of the family believes that their power comes from Anastasias pact with their patron to gain vengeance on her husbands murderers, 
      Mordechai knows that their parton has been manipulating the two families for centuries, and had in fact, engineered the marriage between Saul Dumas and Anastasia Lavaux. The devil has been steering the clans to this 
      point in history to help with his attempt to ascend to power in the nine hells. Mordechai has not passed along this information to the rest of the family and is unsure how he feels about he and his family being 
      the unwitting instuments of a devil or what to do about it.

    #
    personality: |
      Mordechai Dumas is abonormally tall and thin. Whispy red hair brushes across his mostly bald head. His thick glasses sit on top of his large, angular nose obsucring his familial violet eyes. He wears finely tailored robes 
      and is never without a book in his hands. He is quiet and scholarly and mostly keeps to himself. He spends most of his time travelling and researching in libraries throughout the realm, gathering knowledge and power. 
      Hes not a very social individual, but can definitely be engaged in scholarly conversations and debates
