    background-story: |
      He grew up in a Triton city and lived there until his early teens, when he accompanied a team to dry land for the first time. There he saw a firestorm and while the other Tritons avoided it, he felt irresistibly drawn to it and has loved fire since. However, he once accidentally burned a valuable book while playing with the fire and is constantly looking for ways to feed his pyromaniac self while not burning any books and avoiding the natural uncomfortable feeling that most Tritons have around fire.
