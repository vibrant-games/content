# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Eugene Vardkelmp was found as a very young boy, abandoned and wandering in the mountains. He was taken in and adopted by Oswald Varfklemp. As he's grown Oswald has begun teaching him the ways of an artificer. Eugene 
      has also taken a strong interest in medicine and healing and has taken up the studies of a Life Domain Cleric to further his interests. In order to learn more about his chosen paths, he splits his time between studying 
      artifice with his adopted father and biology with Ulther Hapwath and Thadeus Periwinkle.

    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Eugene Vardklemp is an absolutle mountain of a young man. Almost 8' tall and 330lbs of solid muscle. His skin is a deep gray and specled with lines of black callous. He wears plain but well made clothes covered by a 
      massive lab coat that helps him feel like he fits in at the Collegium with the rest of the far more experienced researchers and scientists. Eugene makes up for his lack on knowledge with enthusiam and a strong work 
      ethic he is always willing to give any of the other Collegium members a hand with any little thing. He is exceptionally loyal to his adopted father and will do pretty much anything that is asked of him. He is reasonably 
      clever but very naive and often finds himself the butt of many of the Collegium's goblin assistants jokes.
