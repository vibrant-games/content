    background-story: |
      Driven out of his clan when he was challenged by a younger, stronger Bugbear for the role of pack alpha, he went into exile rather than die fighting for leadership. He wandered for several years fending for himself before he was captured by slavers and sold into servitude as an enforcer/security. He found that he relished his new role as it provided a steady meal, a frequent outlet for his aggression and as little thinking as possible
