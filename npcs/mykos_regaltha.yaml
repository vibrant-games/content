# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

                          moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.
      - Bracers of Defense: +2 to Action

                                telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it. You can use an action to cause the ring to become Invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or
                                until you die. If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for The Afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring,
                                you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this Telepathic Communication.      
      - Animated Shield: While holding this Shield, you can speak its Command word as a Bonus Action to cause it to animate. The Shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, 
                         leaving your hands free. The Shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a Bonus Action to end this Effect, or until you are Incapacitated or die, at which point the Shield falls to the ground or
                         into your hand if you have one free.
      - Beacon: +2 to Strength
      - Pants of Holding: These pants have pockets with an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The pants can hold up to 500 pounds, not 
                          exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The pants weighs 15 pounds, regardless of their contents. Retrieving an item from the pants requires an action. If the pants are overloaded, pierced, or torn, they 
                          ruptures and are destroyed, and their contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the pant's pockets are turned inside out, their contents spill forth, unharmed, but the pants must be put right 
                          before they can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the pants can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin 
                          to suffocate. Placing a pants of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
                          The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random Location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate 
                          is one-way only and can't be reopened.
       - Brooch of Shielding: Resistance to Force Damage and immunity to Magic Missle. Grants the wearer the ability to communicate telepathically within 30 feet. Allows the wearer to cast the spell Fairy Fire 3 times pe day
       - Wand of Magic Missle: This wand has 7 Charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its Charges to cast the Magic Missile spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the 
                               spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20.
                               On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed. 
       - Rod of Security: While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. 
                          You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery Tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless
                          of its Nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower 
                          picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space. For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, 
                          creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). When the time 
                          runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the Location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that Location. The rod can't be used again until 
                          ten days have passed.                        
       - Bag of Beans: Inside this heavy cloth bag are 6 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending
                       from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites 
                       flammable Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an Effect 1 minute later from the ground 
                       where it was planted. The DM can choose an Effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an Effect.                    
       - A Selection of Fine Cigars
       - A large Selection of poitions, poisons and ointments
       - Several spell scrolls
       - Several Red Wizard's of Thay's Head's preserved in pickle jars

    background-story: |
      Mykos grew up in the Underdark with his tribe of Tieflings. His father, Rophelos, was the Khan and his mother, Mytha, a Queen of their kind. As war among the denizens of the Underdark continued to rage, his tribe ceased to
      worship thier traditional gods in favor of one of the old forgotten gods; Kezef, The Hound of Rot. As his tribe delved deeper into the following of Kezef, their raids became ruthless. Killing and wanton destruction for the
      sake of killing and wanton destruction. The also bagan taking prisoners to use as slaves. This didn't sit well with Mykos as he had always had a pronounced sense of fairness and justice. When he brought his concerns to his
      parents he was forced to fight his older brother Rophelor to the death in single combat. Mykos defeated his brother, but refused to deliver the killing blow. Mykos then escaped from his tribe, finding his way out of the 
      Undrdark, taking himself into exile. Shortly after leaving the Underdark, he found a lone Half-Orc named Ordic and an exiled Drow, Etzio, and the three outcasts set out on the road of adventure, gaining fame and fortune 
      over the years, becoming known as "The Forgotten". Using their new found wealth to buy a tavern, settling in the small shanty town of Phandalin, and opening Ardenthal's Rest. Recently his Brother Rophelor came back into 
      his life, now also exiled from their tribe and escorted by, much to Mykos' surprise, a daughter that Mykos had never known existed.

    personality: |
      Mykos is average height but built like a brick wall of muscle. He has deep red skin, lang black hair and short-cropped beard. He has white eyes and thick curled horns like a ram. He wears short cut pants (pants of holding)
      with his long muscular tail hanging out the back above his hoofed feat. He also wears the trophies of his triumphs, A necklace of troll teeth, the thick, red, woolen cloak of a fallen Red Wizard and the blood-soak hat of a 
      slain redcap over top of the specially-made helmet that fits around his horns. He also has a large tattoo of a naked lady on his left arm. Mykos is gruff, intimidating and impetuous, often acting without thinking and 
      barrelling headlong into danger, despite his acute danger sense. Once battle commences though, there are few more violent, cunning and aggressive. Despite his tendency towards violence, Mykos also has a keenly developed 
      sense of fairness and justice. He also has a strong aversion to authority in general, but specifically to the tenets and intervenions of the many gods of the realm. He also has a special distatse for slavers, and a 
      genuine hatred of the Red Wizards of Thay in particular. He has also been known to go out of his way to provoke any authority figure that crosses his path, especially those who see him as lesser.
