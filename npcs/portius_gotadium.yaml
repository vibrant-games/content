# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

       - Artificers Lore: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magical, alchemical, or technological items, you can add twice your proficiency bonus instead of any other proficiency bonus that may apply
       - Tinker:  You have proficiency with artisan tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function
                  after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up
                  to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options - 
                  - Clockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in
                                   a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
                  - Fire Starter: The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.
                  - Music Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
                  
   - - Doctor Abilities:
       - Medical Training: Due to your meticulous study into the healing arts you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for Medicine checks. In addition your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
                           Medicine checks that you make. 
       - Doctors Bag: you gain access to a number of special supplies due to your medical training. These supplies include things like bandages, syringes, medicinal powders, and healing salves. You keep these in a storage
                      container of your choice such as a bag, a series of pouches, or even a trunk. As long as you have access to your Doctor's Bag you may use an action to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without
                      needing to make a Medicine check.
       - First Aid: you can apply basic first aid to an adjacent creature you can touch. As a bonus action you heal the target for 1d4 hit points. This increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th
                    level (4d4). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier + 1. You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
       - Second Opinion: you have become accustomed not only to combat, but to coordinating with other healers. Whenever an ally within 20ft of you uses a healing ability, spell, or item, you can use your reaction to increase
                         the amount healed to a single target by half, rounded up. Your ally must be able to see or hear you.
       - Patch Up: you have learned that there is always another fight around the corner, and it's best to be ready for it. Select up to 6 willing creatures that you can touch. You spend the next 10 minutes quickly stitching up
                   any open wounds and applying painkillers where needed, whatever it takes to get them to the next battle. This cures them of any non-magical ailments and restores a number of hit points equal to half of their
                   maximum rounded up. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier divided by two (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
       - Diagnosis: you have learned to treat hostile scenarios as just another day at the office. As an action you study a living creature and gain vital insight towards its physical state. You learn one of the targets
                    following statistics - Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, Highest Saving Throw, Lowest Saving Throw, or whether or not the creature is below half its health. You can use this
                    feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
       - Paramedic: you have become experienced at reaching the injured without taking damage. When you use your action to disengage you may also double your movement speed until the end of your turn
       - Vaccination: you have spent countless hours attempting to aid those suffering from disease and have developed a number of treatments. As an action you can cure a target of a single disease afflicting them. Alternatively,
                      you can inoculate a target against disease for the next 24 hours. In addition, due to exposure from numerous patients the doctor gains immunity to all disease.

   - - Surgeon Abilities:
       - Expert Practice:  you can now add your intelligence modifier to the result of any healing ability you perform.
       - Surgery: you have gained the confidence to delve deeper into the bodies of your patients. You operate on an injured subject, curing them of any ailments, both mundane and magical. The target regains a number of hit points
                  equal to their maximum. Any hit points the target gains over their maximum become temporary hit points. This takes 2 full hours from start to finish.

                             the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points ceases to be poisoned and is cured of any disease.</p><p>They carry one at all times and

       - Robe of Useful Items: adventuring gear (wondrous item robe)This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe. you can use an action to detach one of the patches causing it to

    background-story: |
     Life in the gnomish city of Aberash Caandu is always lively - filled with tinkerer products wobbling about and wondrous inventions that would amaze even the most experienced traveler. The gnomes of this city have always
     been accepting of all other races and inter-racial marriage and offspring are not uncommon. Portius is a product of this accepting community and raised in their meticulously productive and innovative cultural practices.
     Knowing from their youth that they were not only a mixed-race person but also gender fluid, Portius presents powerful qualities of both masculinity and femininity. With close-cut cropped hair and a muscular, broad build,
     they seem tomboyish. Yet their graceful hands and attention to details - in their work, appearance, and environment - reflect a feminine edge. As they matured, they took on the best of each race. They chose not to
     tinker, per se, at least not with 'inventions' but instead with the biology of peoples. They took to the role of a doctor easily and quickly became the community's go-to for anything that would ail them. They also picked
     up on the talents of the local Dwarven community and learned the sophisticated methods of rectification - distilling and producing fine spirits. In addition, their skills with a sharp edge and attention to detail leant
     themselves well to barbering. Portius was and is seen as something of a pragmatic polymath. The wonderful outcome of the mixing of Gnomish and Dwarven genetics and culture. Portius has since set out on their own to
     pursue a greater good among the regions. She has settled in the city of Tyrwind [any large city] where they have set up a sturdy shack on the outskirts of the market. Their small shop operates as an underclass clinic. Here
     she also distills and bottles fine spirits for sale to taverns, inns, and the public. She has a brand called, "Moorehouse', made up of various rums and whiskeys. Portius has since joined the regional Doctors' Guild,
     which has a small population of members. They have also been a founding member of the Rectifiers' guild. Both to protect practitioners of little-known and rarely practiced professions. They seek to use their membership to
     these guilds to push them to dismantle - through strategically intellectual and political means - the mercantile churches. Because of these goals, she is currently a target of Morion DeFaye and his clergy. Although these
     mercantile abbots would never outright assassinate anyone, they keep close watch over her operations. Although very gender fluid in their performance of gender, Portius' biological sex is female and her sexual
     preference oscillates frequently.

    personality: |
     Portius is an smart and accomplished doctor with a rebelious streak. They are also skilled in the fine art of spirit-making, a hobby which they have fashioned into a profitable source of income. As a person of many talents,
     they are also a capable barber and love doing people's hair. Multi-talented and driven to succeed in every facet of their life, they're also compelled to fight for social justice as well. They strongly disagree with the 
     practices and teachings of the mercantile churches and have devoted their spare time to breaking their hold on their society. They have used some of their professional clout through the various guilds that they belong to,
     to further this aim. They know that this has painted a target on their back as an enemy of the churches, and are weary of stranegrs because of it.
