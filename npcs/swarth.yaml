  # I guess we decided it was not an important field.
  # This was a pretty bad oversigh.  :(

    background-story: |
      <p>Swarth was born large to large parents. His mother's breasts would have firehosed a more delicate babe, and his father's flatulence alone could knock out a vast forest filled with yellow canaries. Both parents were chefs, and both died of diabetes when Swarth was in his teens.<p><p>By then he had acquired talents for curing and preparing meats, to a level that his parents had never quite achieved. While desserts were his father's specialties, and potato dishes his mother's, Swarth prepared liver pastes and deep fried pseudodragons like no other. He worked his way up slowly, from cook to sous-chef to chef, often replacing his predecessor by virtue of fearsomeness and a frighteningly sharp cleaver.</p><p>He owns the tavern where he is now barkeep and head chef, having spent half a lifetime (and several subordinates) there.  Two pale spotty boys help out with the cooking and food preparation during busy hours, and the waitress roles are filled from a revolving door pf ladies of all ages, shapes and sizes.</p><p>Swarth's food comprises layers of various types of meat, exquisitely arranged, often with a liver paste "S" signature on top.</p><p>During a recent bar mitzvah catered by Swarth, Flee -- whether deliberately or accidentally -- slapped Swarth in the face with a chain.  Ever since, Swarth has been trying to find Flee.  He does not know what punishment lies in store for Flee, only that face is important to be saved.</p>
