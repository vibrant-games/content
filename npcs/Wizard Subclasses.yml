       - Advanced Spell Secrets: you understand some of the more complex aspects of magic, and can alter its form to how you see fit. When you cast a spell that uses a spell slot and requires a saving throw, you can use your 
                                 bonus action to expend 3 lore points and change the ability score of the saving throw. You can change a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw to any other in that list, and you can

                          have spell slots for, and you still follow the rules of casting it, such as having material components (if needed), expending a spell slot etc. You cannot cast rituals with this ability.

                        the strings. Pulling all strings attached to an enemy will rip the fabric of space slightly dealing force damage equal to the number of strings attached times your intelligence modifier. Strings that were
                        pulled immediately vanish. Pulling 5 or more strings creates a void in space that pulls all creatures within 10 feet of the target. Creatures must succeed on a strength save against your spell DC or get 
                        sucked 5 feet closer to the target and its movement speed is reduced to 0 unitl your next turn. For every 5 stings pulled the radius increases by 5 feet
       - Unwind Spell: You can use your reaction to stop an enemy's spell. If a spell is cast within 60 feet of you, it can be broken into a magical thread. You can then use your bonus action to wind the thread into a magical

                       level. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier per long rest.
       - Arcane Weaver: You can use your action to concentrate on the strings, as long as you maintain concentration the strings don't disappear even when used. The strings vanish after 10 minutes or if you lose concentration. 
                        While concentrating on the strings, you can feel any creature, projectile or spell within 60 feet of you. For every 5 strings (to a maximum of 15 strnigs) you gain advantage on attacks on any creature 
                        within 60 feet and you can use your reation to gain +2 to your AC or to saving throws against spells that target you.  You also gain Blindsight within 60 feet.

                         up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump 
                         twice as far as normal, and it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it
                         has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller  
       - Gravity Well: you've learned how to manipulate gravity around a living being: whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to 
                       move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.
       - Violent Attraction: when another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase the attack's velocity, causing the attack's target to take an extra 1d10 
                             damage of the weapon's type. Alternatively, if a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to increase the fall's damage by 2d10. You can use this feature a 
                             number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                        For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, 
                        and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement. Once you use this 
                        feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.

         - Evocation Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy an Evocation spell into Your Spellbook is halved.
         - Sculpt Spells: you can create pockets of relative safety within the Effects of your Evocation Spells. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them 
                          equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their Saving Throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
         - Potent Cantrip: your damaging Cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the Effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) 
                           but suffers no additional Effect from the cantrip.
         - Empowered Evocation: you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any Wizard Evocation spell you cast.
         - Overchannel: you can increase the power of your simpler Spells. When you cast a Wizard spell of 1st through 5th Level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you 
                        suffer no adverse Effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this 
                        feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the necrotic damage per Spell Level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores Resistance and immunity. 
                        
                        
                        
   - - School of Abjuration Abilities:
       - Abjuration Savant:  the gold and time you must spend to copy a abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Arcane Ward: you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself
                      that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage
                      reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher,
                      the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.
       - Projected Ward: when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded
                         creature takes any remaining damage.
       - Improved Abjuration: when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in Counterspell and Dispel Magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability 
                              check.
       - Spell Resistance: you have advantage on saving throws against spells. Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

                 or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each
                 foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls
       - Expert Divination: casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain
                            one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level
