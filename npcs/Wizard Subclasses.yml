   - - School of Lore Mastery Abilities:
       - Lore Master: you become an increasingly broader compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Choose one skill from Arcana, History, Nature or Religion. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that 
                      uses the chosen skill if you are proficient in that skill. At levels 6, 10 and 14 you get to choose one more skill from the list. In addition, your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, 
                      rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice). Your proficiency bonus is also doubled for any ability check that uses
                      the Investigation skill if you are proficient in that skill. neither this feature nor the previous feature gives proficiency in any skill           
       - Spell Secrets: you start to master your first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies. Choose two damage types from acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant or thunder. When you 
                        cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and the spell deals one of the chosen damage types you can substitute that damage type with another (previously) chosen damage type from the list. You can use this 
                        feature a number of times equal to your Inteligence Modifier (minimum of once~ and only a single damage type may be substituted per spell You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. At 
                        levels 6, 10 and 14 you get to choose two more damage types from the list. Additionally, when you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from
                        one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
       - Arcane Analyser: you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic
                          into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend. An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, 
                          increase the damage against one target of your choice by 2dl0 force damage. lfthe spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell. An 
                          additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell's range. If the spell's range is at least 30 feet, it's range is tripled, or it becomes 1/4 of a mile (whichever is greater) An additional 3rd-
                          level spell slot can increase the spell's potency. Increase the spell's save DC by 2 for one turn against all targets.

                            you finish a long rest. Additionally, pick two more skills from the list mentioned in Lore Master. If you are proficient in the skills you chose, your proficiency bonus is doubled when you make a 
                            check using that skill. If you are not proficient in that skill, you become proficient.
       - Master of Magic: your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spelL but doing so too frequently will have consequences as the efforts needed to do it wears out both mind and body. As a bonus action, you 
                          can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any class's spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn't have it prepared, and you follow the 
                          normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn't a wizard spelL it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when 
                          you finish casting or concentrating (if applicable) on it. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, and if you use it more than five times per tenday you gain one level of 
                          exhaustion and your hit point maximum is lowered by 5d8 + (5 times the number of uses after the fifth use) psychic damage per use after the fifth use. The only way to heal the damage and begin lowering 
                          your levels of exhaustion caused by this feature is by finishing another long rest. These effects cannot be reduced or negated in any way by anything other a direct intervention from a deity or careful 
                          usage of a legendary, sentient artifact magic item which has the appropriate effects (like The Fates card from the Deck of Many Things) and the damage ignores resistance or immunity conferred by 
                          anything other than of equal or greater power to that of an artifact

       - Magical Weaving: you can try to change a spell that travels through or that its effect happens within 15 feet of you. Before the spell performs the desired effect, by using your reaction you try to make the spell being 
                          cast into another spell of 1 lower level that you have prepared You can't modify can trips using this feature. You roll one d20 and add your proficiency bonus, the DC to be able to change the spell is 
                          15 +(spell Level) to modify it into an even lower spell level. the DC increases by 2 per level you want to lower the spell You can also choose to try to empower a targeting spell from an ally, you can 
                          use your reaction to increase the spell level by one at the point of casting. The DC is 15 +(spell level). If the spell can't be enhanced, nothing happens. If you succeed to modify the spel~ You are 
                          unable to cast spells other than can trips on your next turn.
       - Arcane Thread: you learned about the effect of casting magic in the fabric of space. You have learned to passively thread a mix of magic and soul onto space, this string is intangible unless touched by you. This causes 
                        every targeting spell that is cast within 120 feet of you to create a thread that remains in place for 30 seconds. You can use your bonus action to pull all strings close to you. Successfully hitting the 
                        target attaches the string. Pulling all strings attached to an enemy will rip the fabric of space slightly dealing force damage equal to number of strings attached times your intelligence modifier. The 
                        strings that were pulled immediately vanish. Pulling 5 or more strings creates a void in space that pulls all creatures within 10 feet of the target. Creatures must succeed on a strength save against your
                        spell save DC or get sucked 5 feet closer to the target and lose its movement speed until your next turn. The radius increases by 5 feet for every 5 threads you pull If there is an ongoing concentration 
                        spell you are able to see a thread from the spell to the point where the caster is. You can do this once after a short or long rest.

                       to wind it up into a clew of magical energy. This clew lasts until the end of your next turn, While you are holding the clew, you can cast the enemy's spell only at the level the enemy was casting. You 
                       still require to use the necessary spell slot. The DC to be able to break the spell is 17 +(spell Level), you roll one d20 and add your proficiency bonus. You can use this feature a number equal to your 
                       intelligence modifier (Minimum of 1) you gain all your number of uses back after a long rest.
       - Arcane Weaver: Weaving Magical energy has given you a connection to the weave itself. This lets you feel the weave as an extension of yourself. You can use your action to concentrate on the strings and while maintaining
                        concentration, the strings do not vanish. All strings vanish after 10 minutes or when you lose concentration. You can feel any creature, projectile or magical effects that surges or gets within 60 feet of
                        you. For every 5 strings, you gain + 1 to attack rolls against any creature within 60 feet and you can use your reaction to gain +2 to your AC or saving throw against an attack or spell Once you reach 15 
                        strings, your senses can't be improved any further. You also gain blindsight within those 60 feet.

                         up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump 
                         twice as far as normal, and it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it
                         has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller  
       - Gravity Well: you've learned how to manipulate gravity around a living being: whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to 
                       move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.
       - Violent Attraction: when another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase the attack's velocity, causing the attack's target to take an extra 1d10 
                             damage of the weapon's type. Alternatively, if a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to increase the fall's damage by 2d10. You can use this feature a 
                             number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Event Horizon: as an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). 
                        For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, 
                        and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement. Once you use this 
                        feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.
                        
                        
                        
   - - School of Evocation Abilities:
         - Evocation Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy an Evocation spell into Your Spellbook is halved.
         - Sculpt Spells: you can create pockets of relative safety within the Effects of your Evocation Spells. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them 
                          equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their Saving Throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
         - Potent Cantrip: your damaging Cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the Effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) 
                           but suffers no additional Effect from the cantrip.
         - Empowered Evocation: you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any Wizard Evocation spell you cast.
         - Overchannel: you can increase the power of your simpler Spells. When you cast a Wizard spell of 1st through 5th Level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you 
                        suffer no adverse Effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this 
                        feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the necrotic damage per Spell Level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores Resistance and immunity. 
                        
                        
                        
   - - School of Abjuration Abilities:
       - Abjuration Savant:  the gold and time you must spend to copy a abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Arcane Ward: you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself
                      that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage
                      reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher,
                      the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.
       - Projected Ward: when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded
                         creature takes any remaining damage.
       - Improved Abjuration: when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (as in Counterspell and Dispel Magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that ability 
                              check.
       - Spell Resistance: you have advantage on saving throws against spells. Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.
       
       
       
   - - School of Divination Abilities:
       - Divination Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy a Divination spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Potent: when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw,
                 or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each
                 foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls
       - Expert Divination: casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain
                            one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level
       - The Third Eye:  you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can't
                         use the feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
                         - Darkvision: You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
                         - Ethereal Sight: You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.
                         - Greater Comprehension: You can read any language.

   - - Order of Scribes Abilities: 
       - Wizardly Quill: as a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:
                         - The quill doesn’t require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
                         - The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
                         - You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.
                         - This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die
       - Awakened Spellbook: Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook. At 2nd level, while you are holding the book, 
                             it grants you the following benefits - 
                             - You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
                             - When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula 
                               for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
                             - When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long 
                               rest.
                             - If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end 
                               of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed 
                               somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.
       - Manifest Mind: you can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space
                        of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a 
                        scholar from the past (your choice). While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears
                        (no action required). Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per
                        day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you
                        or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts Dispel Magic on it, if the Awakened 
                        Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action. Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 
                        any level to conjure it again.
       - Master Scrivner: whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied 
                          onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the 
                          spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell 
                          vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest. You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
                          The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill
       - One with the Word: your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, 
                            as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore. Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss 
                            the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, 
                            if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't
                            enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points. Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another
                            spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spell book. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest
                            
                            
                            
   - - School of Transmutation Abilities: 
       - Transmutation Savant:  the gold and time you must spend to copy a Transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Minor Alchemy: when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one 
                        object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you 
                        can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
       - Transmuters Stone: you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice 
                            as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options;
                            - Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet
                            - An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered
                            - Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
                            - Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)
                            Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases
                            to function.
       - Shapechanger: you add the Polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast 
                       whose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast Polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot
       - Master Transmuter: you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's 
                            stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
                            - Major Transformation.: You can transmute one nonmagical object – no larger than a 5-foot cube – into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 
                                                     10 minutes handling the object to transform it.
                            - Panacea: You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
                            - Restore Life: You cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.
                            - Restore Youth: You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's 
                                             lifespan.
                                             
                                             
                                             
   - - School of Illusion Abilities:
       - Illusion Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy a Illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Improved Minor Illusion: you learn the Minor Illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. 
                                  When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.           
       - Malleable Illusion: when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), 
                             provided that you can see the illusion.
       - Illusory Self: you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory
                        duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Illusory Reality: you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical 
                           object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can 
                           create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross. The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.
                           
                           
                           
   - - School of Enchantment Abilities:
       - Enchantment Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy a Enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Hypnotic Gaze: when you choose this school, your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or 
                        hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is 
                        incapacitated and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more
                        than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against 
                        this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
       - Instinctive Charm: when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The 
                            attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple 
                            creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this 
                            feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
       - Split Enchantment: when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.
       - Alter Memories: you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it 
                         remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must 
                         succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less
                         time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.
                         
                         
                         
   - - School of War Magic Abilities:
       - Arcane Deflection: you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that 
                            attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw. When you use this feature, you can’t cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.
       - Tactical Wit: your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.
       - Power Surge: you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a
                      long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with Dispel Magic or Counterspell, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you 
                      end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge. Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to 
                      that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.
       - Durable Magic: the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.
       - Deflecting Shroud: your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice within 60 feet
                            of you each take force damage equal to half your wizard level.
                            
                            
                            
   - - School of Necromancy Abilities:
       - Necromancy Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy a Necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Grim Harvest: you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to 
                       twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.
       - Undead Thralls: you add the Animate Dead spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as 
                         appropriate. Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits;
                         - The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.
                         - The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.
       - Inured to Undeath: you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to 
                            some of their worst effects.
       - Command Undead: you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a 
                         Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature
                         again. Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence 
                         of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

                            side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. The object disappears 
                            after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.
       - Benign Transportation: you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If 
                                that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.
       - Focused Conjuration: while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.
       - Durable Summons: any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.

                        saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll. You can use this ability 
                        twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Temporal Awareness: you can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.
       - Momentary Stasis: as an action, you can magically force a Large or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the saving throw is a success,
                           the creature is encased in a field of magical energy until the end of your next turn or until the creature takes any damage. While encased in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 
                           0. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Arcane Abeyance: when you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can condense the spell's magic into a mote. The spell is frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 1 
                          hour. This bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is destroyed, it vanishes in a flash of light, and the 
                          spell is lost. A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the 
                          creature who released it as the caster for all other purposes. Once you create a bead with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Convergent Future: you can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them into events around you, ensuring a particular outcome. When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack 
                            roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to ignore the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed to succeed or one less than that number (your 
                            choice). When you use this feature, you gain one level of exhaustion. Only by finishing a long rest can you remove a level of exhaustion gained in this way.

   - - School of Hedge Magic Abilities:
       - Scholar of Fundments: you have devoted yourself to the study and perfection of fundamental magics, giving you especial insight and esoteric knowledge. You learn three cantrips of your choice from any class's spell List 
                              (each can come from different Lists). You Learn three additional cantrips in this way at wizard level 6, 10 and 14. Cantrips learned in this way count as wizard cantrips for you.
       - Big on the Basics: your heightened study of cantrip magic is asserted by the ease with which it is cast and maintained. You can simultaneously concentrate on a cantrip and one other spell. In addition, you can dismiss 
                            any number of cantrips or cantrip effects as a bonus action. Lastly, cantrips you cast don't need material components and only need either a verbal or somatic component (you choose which when casting)
       - Practice Makes Perfect: well-practised cantrips benefit from your considerable expertise, honed to the verge of perfection. When you cast a can trip, choose one of the following benefits to apply to it
                                 - if the cantrip has a range other than sel£, you can double its range. if its range is touch, it becomes 10 feet.
                                 - if the cantrip has a duration of 1 minute or Longer, you can choose to either double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours, or increase its duration to 1 hour.
                                 - The cantrip's targets have disadvantage on saving throws made against it, and you have advantage on the next attack roll made with that cantrip during the current turn.
                                 - if the cantrip's effects would end when you cast it again, they instead end when you cast it again while you already have two or more instances or that cantrip active.
       - Swift Cantrip: casting basic magic becomes second nature to you, no more trying than a terse word or wave or a hand When you cast a cantrip that has a casting time or 1 action, you can cast it with 1 bonus action 
                        instead if you do, you aren't restricted from casting another spell during the current turn. A spell cast in this way grants its targets resistance to the damage it deals and can't grant you resistance to
                        damage.

                               when casting a cantrip, you can now choose up to two of Practice Made Per£ect's effects to apply to it instead of one.

                              gold and time you must spend to copy a cleric spell into your spell book is halved.
       - Dark Knowledge: you can draw upon your expansive knowledge of creatures to recall and exploit its weaknesses. To do so, you use an action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you 
                         that you can see. Make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Nature), or Intelligence (Religion) chook, depending on the creature type. Your DM may raise or lower this DC depending on the rarity 
                         of the crearure. On a success, you discern the creature's attack patterns and combat techniques, granting all allies that can hear you a +2 bonus to attack rolls against it for I minute. This bonus also 
                         applies to other creatures of the same species as the target. Once this feature ends, or if you fail your initial skill check. you can't use this feature on that species of creature again until you 
                         finish a short test. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You do not expend a use if you fail the skill check. You regain any expended uses after a long rest.

                              flooding the target's mind with overwhelming visions of incomprehensible horror. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. A target automatically succeeds on this
                              saving throw if it is an aberration or if it can't be frightened. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving 
                              throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended
                              uses when you finish a long rest.

                                benefits until you die, you perform the ritual again, or you choose to end the effect when you finish a long rest.

                                  check or save. In addition, whenever you cast a spell with a range of touch, your reach for it extends to 10 feet.
                                - A number of cold, expressionless eyes are strewn across your body. You have advantage on initiative rolls as well as Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

       - Abjuration Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Minor Glyph: when you select this school, you can write small glyphs upon a surface or an object, embedding a magical effect into your writing. Using a 1 minute ritual, you can write a glyph upon a surface or object no 
                      larger than 5 ft. in diameter. lf you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast it, the glyph is broken, and it ends without being 
                      triggered. The glyphs created last for 24 hours or until you move more than 500 feet away from them. You may have a number of glyphs active equal to your intelligence modifier. The glyph is nearly invisible
                      and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. The glyph is triggered when a creature other than its creator moves within 5 feet of it. You can further 
                      refine the trigger so the glyph activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect 
                      aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe a glyph, choose alerting glyph or
                      cantrip glyph.
                      Alerting Glyph: When triggered, this glyph alerts you with a ping in your mind. The ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
                      Cantrip Glyph: You can store a cantrip that you know by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast
                                     in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is 
                                     centered on that creature. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
       - Expert Warding: you add the glyph of warding spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast glyph of warding, you no longer need to provide material components, and the spell's cast time is reduced to
                         10 minutes.
       - Major Glyph: when you create a glyph using your minor glyph feature, you can use more powerful spell effects. When you inscribe a glyph, you can choose spell glyph.
                      Spell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 1st level in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate
                                   effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, 
                                   the area is centered on that creature. Ifthe spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell 
                                   requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. If you choose this option, the casting time of the ritual is increased to 10 minutes. You may not have multiple spell-glyphs
                                   active at a time, but they do not count against your total number of glyphs active.
       - Master of Glyphcraft: you add the symbol spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast symbol, you no longer need to provide material components.
