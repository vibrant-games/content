# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      The son of Yakahe's human ambassador to the High-Elves of Silverleaf and a Elven diplomat, Corrora had it all as a child and young man. Intelligent and athletic, he excelled on the training field and under the tutelage of 
      the local sages who taught the children of minor Nobles in his home; the city of Baraithton. As an adolescent, Corrora began to have extremely vivid nightmares of himself committing terrible, violent acts. The nightmares 
      progressed to the point where the previously gregarious nobleman's son turned sullen and dour. The lack of sleep caused him to be irritable, constantly snapping at his family, his tutors, and his friends. The feeling of 
      isolation only made the problem worse. The nightmares because more violent, more vivid, and more frequent the more withdrawn he became. One day the nightmares became reality. A skirmish with his younger brother, Yarith 
      ended in bloodshed. While wrestling, Corrora blacked out. When he came to his senses, he was holding a sharpened shard of rock with his Yarith's blood dripping from it and his brother's limp body beneath him. Dropping the 
      stone in horror, Corrora was touched by the Goddess Lenterra (Goddess of arcane knowledge) for the first time. He could feel her hand reaching through him as he cradled his Yarith's head in his lap. A soft glowing light 
      encompassed them both. And, Yarith breathed. That night, and for several nights after, Corrora had the same dream: he was floating above his body watching as his eyes became red with a hint of flickering fire followed by 
      him reaching for a rock and slashing Yarith's throat with it. This was not the last time something like this happened to Corrora. At the suggestion of Lenterra, Corrora began to deepen his study of the arcane and religion 
      in search of a cure for his condition. His natural curiosity lent itself to him becoming a renowned expert in arcane and ancient religious phenomenon. This research led him to discover that the Elvish side of his heritage 
      held some deep ancient secrets. A number of his ancestors had committed despicable acts millenia ago. The acts they committed were the very acts he dreams about so vividly. The ancestors were the very ancestors who's 
      spirits overcame his body when under too much stress from imminent danger. Corrora is constantly in search of a way to rid himself from his ancestor's curse. This search is what originally brought him to Eberston and the 
      Yakahe frontier far from his family.
