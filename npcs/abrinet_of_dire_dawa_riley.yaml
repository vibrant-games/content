# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      The Drow are a largely rejected race in the Realms. Numeorus tribes have departed from traditional ways in hopes of achieving peace for themselves and between themselves and the denizens of the Upper World. The clans 
      of Dire Dawa [Any Underdark Village] of North Woreda [Any Underdark Region] seek such noble ends. A self-appointed council of diplomats in this village have made it their goal to spread the word that the people of the 
      Underdark are best set to survive and flourish with the cooperation of the other races of the Realms. Since most magic is under strict control within most of the Underdark and thus messages and missives are 
      difficult to convey, the peoples of Dire Dawa needed to rely on actual footwork to pass messages between and across the peoples of the Underdark who sought to escape the control of the few dark deities who had gained 
      the majority of control in the regions. They relied on 'runners' to bring messages back and forth. Abrinet was chosen as one of the few to play this revered position. Although not the fittest or most able, it was 
      her commitment to absolving the Underdark of its ills that convinced her town council to appoint her as a 'runner'. She has yet to let them down, except for her more than occasional travels to the Upperworld.

      Riley is a young and pretty Drow with long black hair with dyed pink tips, deep red eyes and dark gray skin. She has a lithe, muscular body that she wraps in silk tights and light, black, leather armor. She is perky 
      and plucky, is all about fashion and friends, but unlike many of her peers, has a strong work ethic and believes that he job is very important
