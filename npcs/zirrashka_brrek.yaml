# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Long escaped from the control of Mind Flayers, Zirrash'ka and his tribe also fled the plane of Limbo [Any non-material plane] and integrated themselves among villages of elves on the rim of known civilization. Quietly 
     keeping to themselves and continuting their gratitude towards their patrons, his tribe thirsted for knowledge of the material plane. They formed a monastic tradition that offered worship and tithing to Jegel, the God of 
     Scribes and Depositioner of the Passed (Or any Deity overlooking the passing of the living to the Dead). They pledged to keep track of all those denizens that once lived, how they lived, and when, how, where, and why they 
     died. Over the decades they developed an advanced library and monastary, training their monks in the value of knowledge, gratitude, courage, and direct action.

    personality: |
     Zirrash'ka is the epitome of serious. All business, all the time, he takes his work very very seriously. He watches everything all the time and records everything in his journal to be filed later at the Zerai Library. As a 
     member of a very long-lived species, Zirrash'ka has been wandering and documenting the material plane for a long long time and very little surprises him. He is patient and wise. but very stoic and stern, almost entirely 
     devoid of a sense of humor.
