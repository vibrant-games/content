    background-story: |
      Amera is considerably older than she appears to be. Around 200 years old, though in appearance they are around 25. Urban sprawl forced them from their cliff-side home. As a result they took up a job as a sailor allowing them to travel and be constantly on the move. They also regularly change ships and crews as often as possible to prevent people from learning the truth about what they are. They will usually serve as both a lookout and entertainment on the ships, they will also occasionally function as a companion for the ships captain if the mood takes them. If they need to, they can transform and escape from a situation underwater. They're main goal is their own continued survival as well as mating and perpetuating it's species

# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Amera is considerably older than she appears to be. Around 200 years old, though in appearance they are around 25. Urban sprawl forced them from their cliff-side home. As a result they took up a job as a sailor allowing 
      them to travel and be constantly on the move. They also regularly change ships and crews as often as possible to prevent people from learning the truth about what they are. They will usually serve as both a lookout and 
      entertainment on the ships, they will also occasionally function as a companion for the ships captain if the mood takes them. If they need to, they can transform and escape from a situation underwater. They're main goal 
      is their own continued survival as well as mating and perpetuating it's species
