# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

                      instead of his normal Proficiency Bonus
      Duergar Abilities:
      - Superior Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray           
        Duergar Resilience: You have advantage on saving throws against illusions and against being charmed or paralyzed
        Duergar Magic: When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Enlarge/Reduce spell on yourself once with this trait, using only the spell's enlarge option. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Invisibility spell on
                       yourself once with this trait. You don't need material components for either spell, and you can't cast them while you're in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no effect on them once cast. You regain
                       the ability to cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells
        Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on Attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight

        - 5: Rebuke of the Talisman
        Pact Boon: Pact of the Talisman - Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning
                   the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest. If you lose the talisman, you can perform
                   a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

                       the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language
        Entropis Ward: you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
                       impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't
                       use it again until you finish a short or long rest

    background-story: |
     Aspiring to be the Fountainhead of Clax, the High Duergar God of Pestilence and Destruction, Mammoon will stop at nothing to incarnate herself as the ultimate High Priestess; clad in the bones of a thousand dead, each bone
     tied to the next with the flesh of a thousand more. Mammoon's aspirations come from her abuse at the hands of a former spouse. Married young and corralled into the traditional power positions of a Duergar wife,
     Mammoon sought power over everything else and would be ruthless in this pursuit. She sought the faith of her village, the surrounding region, and eventually the Underdark. Vying for a position as Loxxed Priestess,
     comparable to a magistrate, Mammoon watched as her competitor gained greater and greater favor. This favor grew as her competitor finally had a child. This Duergard tribe had a particularly hard time reproducing and this
     was a sign from their God. Not only did she face ongoing abuse from her husband about her barren womb, Mammoon now faced imminent defeat in her pursuit of power. As the almost Spartan culture would allow, Mammoon
     snatched the child from its bed and brought it to the center idol of Clax, ringing the town bell. Many of her tribe flooded the streets to watch Mamoon sacrifice the child in offering to Clax. The statue reached down,
     scooped up the body, and consumed it violently. Mammoon was then imbued with an overwhelming sense that she was destined for greater things. She denounced the tribe in an animal growl and fled the Underdark in search of
     greater sacrifices to Clax. Seeing such violence in sacrifice has become her primary goal.

    personality: |
      Mamoon Z'Houl is intense and frightening. She is devoted to her god and will tolerate no disrespect. She is entirely manic, demonstrating far more intensity and energy than soneone of her age should have.
