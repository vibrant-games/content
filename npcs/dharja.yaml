    background-story: |
      <p>The town of Hovering Heights [any small settlement], located in the rim of the Pallisade Mountains [Any small to medium Mountain Range] isn't renown for much besides some breads and fruit farming. The peoples of Hovering Heights all long for some kind of excitement and Dharja is no exception.</p><p>Raised in a very humble household of goblinoids repressed into commoners, Dharja learned the skills of his parents, who were general caretakers contracted by local merchants and innkeepers. He longed for adventure and to unleash what he believed to be a vast creative potential within him, but has never had the chance. Instead, he's largely resigned himself to shuffling about with a mop through Lady Sybil's hospital for the infirm.</p>
