# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Hunted for transgressions against the Preistesses of Lollth [Any Drow Deity], Coalwater's family fled the Underdark and largely dispersed among the denizens of the Upperworld with the hope that they would remain out 
      of the purview of their viscious condemners. Consequently, Coalwater was raised among the many races but conditioned to remain largely out of sight. Their family was constantly plagued with the anxiety of being found 
      or sold out and, as such, spent a great deal of energy ensuring that their homesteads and places of business were non-descript and secure from prying eyes. Coalwater picked up on the many innovative techniques that their 
      family would use to secure themselves from potential intrusions.</p><p>As they matured, Coalwater would occasionally wander the market freely yet subtly, spying for goods or peoples who might help them better secure their 
      homestead. It was during one of these outings that they connected with a few roughshod members of the local Thieves' Guild. Quickly becoming friends over conversations about locks and tools, these three youth began to 
      investigate means of overcoming the security of local businesses and magistrates. Calling it 'troubleshooting', they would often come into conflict with the local guards and militia. It was during these brief skirmishes 
      that the three youth decided they would take it upon themselves to contract their skills and knowledge to the local elite with the slogan, 'Three Geese that will honk yer horn - If we can blow it, it need be reborn'.
