    background-story: |
      Leaving her home in the Underdark after her parents murder by surface-dwelling adventurers, she seeks revenge against all Up-worlders. Using her families contacts, she gained entrance and raining from the Assassin's Guild. With her stunning good looks, ruthless aggression and lack of moral norms, she developed the personae of a courtesan and escort. This allows her to get close, personal and passed the guard of her targets. Enjoying the more carnal side of her nature, she does continue to work as an escort when the assassin work is slow, and she's not out hunting the adventurers that murdered her family. She has sworn to hunt and kill those that killed her family and uses most of her spare time and money to accomplish that goal
