   - - Lurker in the Deep Abilities:
       - Grasp of the Deep: you gain the ability to magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle
                            lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle. When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the
                            target takes 1d8 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage) and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the
                            damage dealt by the tentacle increases to 2d8. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack. You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to
                            your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
       - Lurker in the Deep Spells: Spell DC 
          1st: Create or Destroy Water, Thunderwave
          2nd: Gust of Wind, Silence
          3rd: Lightning Bolt, Sleet Storm
          4th: Control Water, Evard’s Black Tentacles
          5th: Commune with Nature, Cone of Cold
       - Scion of the Deep: your patron accepts you into its inner court of servitors. You can telepathically communicate with any aberration, beast, elemental, or monstrosity that has an innate swimming speed, while it is 
                            within 120 feet of you. The creature can understand you and can respond telepathically.
       - Fathomless Soul: your patron grants you greater abilities. You gain the following benefits; 
                          - You can breathe both air and water.
                          - You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
                          - You gain resistance to cold damage.
       - Guardian Grasp: the tentacle you create with Grasp of the Deep can defend you and others. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of 
                         those creatures and reduce the damage to the chosen creature by half. After doing so, the tentacle vanishes.
       - Devouring Maw: you can magically draw forth a manifestation of your patron’s insatiable hunger. As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. For 1 minute, a translucent maw manifests in a 10-foot 
                        radius centered on that point. Each creature in that area when the maw appears must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained. Any creature that starts its turn in the
                        maw’s area takes 3d6 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage). As an action, a restrained creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the restraint on a success. At the start of 
                        your turn, if there is a creature in the maw’s area, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Unleash the Depths: you gain the ability to call upon your patron for aid. As an action, you choose a point within 30 feet of you where your patron tears through reality, manifesting a measure of its thalassic grandeur.
                             Choose one of the following effects to issue from this manifestation point. Once you use either effect, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
                             - Transport: You and up to five willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point are grasped by spectral tentacles and yanked through your patron’s realm. 
                                          The tentacles teleport you and the chosen creatures to a point of your choice within 100 miles that you have visited within the past 24 hours. The tentacles then vanish.
                             - Fury: You can direct a barrage of spectral tentacles to issue forth and strike up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point. Each target must make a Dexterity saving 
                                     throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 cold or lightning damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and
                                     is not knocked prone. The tentacles then vanish
   
   
                                     
   - - Noble Genie Abilities:
       - Collectors Vessel: Your patron gives you a magical vessel with which you can bind a creature to you and to your patron’s menagerie. The vessel is a Tiny object, and it is a spellcasting focus for you. You decide what 
                            the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Collector’s Vessel table.
                            Collector’s Vessel:
                            - d6 Vessel
                            -  1 Oil lamp
                            -  2 Urn
                            -  3 Ring with a compartment
                            -  4 Stoppered bottle
                            -  5 Hollow statuette
                            -  6 Ornate lantern
                            If you lose your vessel, you can perform a 1- hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous vessel. 
                            The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die. As an action while you are holding the vessel, you target a willing creature you can see within 100 feet of you and create a tether of 
                            wispy elemental material that links the target to you. The tether lasts for 1 hour, until you use this feature to create another tether, until the bound target is reduced to 0 hit points, or until 
                            the target ends its turn more than 100 feet from you. While you are tethered to a creature, you gain the following benefits;
                            - You gain a bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).
                            - When you can cast a spell, you can deliver the spell from your space or the bound creature’s space.
                            You can create the tether a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - The Noble Genie Spells: Spell DC 
          1st: Fog Cloud, Sleep
          2nd: Enlarge/Reduce, Phantasmal Force
          3rd: Create Food and Water, Protection from Energy
          4th: Polymorph, Phantasmal Killer
          5th: Bigbys Hand, Creation
       - Elemental Resistance: Your patron grants you protection from an element. Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) until the end of your next long rest. 
                               While the tether of your Collector’s Vessel is active, the tethered creature gains resistance to the damage type you chose.
       - Protective Wish: you’re now able to use your Collector’s Vessel to wish for protection for yourself or your tethered creature. If you or the tethered creature is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to teleport, 
                          swapping places with the creature and switching which one of you is hit by the attack
       - Genies Entertainment: as an action, you can attempt to send a creature you can see within 90 feet to your patron’s court. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be 
                               magically drawn into your vessel and teleported to your patron’s court in the Elemental Planes. While there, the target is stunned and your patron marvels at the target with amusement but brings 
                               no harm to it. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, reappearing in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied on a success.
                               Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. If the target remains in your patron’s court for 1 minute, the genie sends the target back at the end of its turn as 
                               if it successfully saved, and you regain the use of this feature.
       - Collectors Call: in exchange for extending your patron’s influence over the multiverse, you can call on more of their power. As an action, you can implore your patron for aid by making a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
                          against your warlock spell save DC. If the check succeeds, you can choose one of the following effects;
                          - A creature you can see within 60 feet of you regains 8d6 hit points and ends one disease or condition afflicting it; blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
                          - A creature you can see within 60 feet of you has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
                          - You cast the Legend Lore spell without material components.
                          Whether the check succeeds or fails, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. Alternatively, you can regain the use of this feature by sacrificing nonmagical treasure worth at 
                          least 500 gp to your patron. This sacrifice requires the treasure to be within 10 feet of you for at least 1 minute, at the end of which you use an action to teleport the treasure to your patron’s realm,
                          provided you have the vessel of your Collector’s Vessel in hand.

             5th Level: Banishing Smite, Cone of Cold      
        - Hexblades Curse: you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target
                           dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits - 
                           - You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
                           - Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
                           - If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier
        - Hex Warriors: You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long 
                        rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity,
                        for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature,
                        no matter the weapon's type.
        - Accursed Specter:  you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears,
                             it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack 
                             rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife
        - Armor of Hexes: your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, 
                          regardless of its roll
        - Master of Hexes: you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see 
                           within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature

             4th Level: Ice Storm, Locate Creature
             5th Level: Commune, Cone of Cold      
       - Sentinel Raven: you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give 
                         telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to 
                         Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can’t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it 
                         can’t take damage; and it is incapacitated. You can see through the raven’s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it
                         acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours. The raven doesn’t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you
                         from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you,
                         no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.
       - Soul of the Raven: you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven’s form. While merged, you become Tiny, you replace
                            your speed with the raven’s, and you can use your action only to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, or Search. During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. As
                            an action, you and the raven return to normal.
       - Ravens Shield: the Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing. You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the frightened condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.
       - Queens Right Hand: you can channel the Raven Queen’s power to slay a creature. You can cast Finger of Death. After you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

            5th Level: Dominate Person, Telekinesis
         - Awakened Mind: your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with
                          the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language
         - Entropis Ward: you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
                          impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't
                          use it again until you finish a short or long rest 
         - Thought Shield: your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the 
                           same amount of damage that you do.
         - Create Thrall: you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a Remove 
                          Curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the 
                          same plane of existence.

            5th Level: Contagion, Legend Lore
         - Among the Dead: you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease. Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an 
                           undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area 
                           effect, such as the explosion of Fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful
                           save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.
         - Defy Death: you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on 
                       a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
         - Undying Nature: you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. In 
                           addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.
         - Indestructible Life: you partake of some of the true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body 
                                part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

         - Form of Dread: As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed;
                          - You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.
                          - Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of 
                            your next turn.
                          - You are immune to the frightened condition.
                          You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your 
                          patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your face might transform into bat-like features due to your vampire patron.
         - Grave Touched: your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, 
                          you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.
         - Mortal Husk: Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic 
                        damage. In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can cause your body to explode. Each creature within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level. You then revive
                        with 1 hit point in your previous space, along with your gear, and you gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you revive this way, you can’t do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.
         - Spirit Projection: your body is now simply a vessel for your spirit. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation. Your 
                              spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body 
                              magically teleports to your spirit’s space (your choice). While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits;
                              - Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
                              - When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.
                              - You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
                              - While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
                              Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

         - Dark Ones Blessing: when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).
         - Dark Ones Own Luck: you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial
                               roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
         - Fiendish Resilience: you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or 
                                silver weapons ignores this resistance.
         - Hurl Through Hell: when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At 
                              the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its 
                              horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

            5th Level: Bigby's Hand (appears as a tentacle), Cone of Cold
         - Tentacle of the Deep: you can magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 
                                 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle. When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target 
                                 takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d8. As a bonus action on your turn,
                                 you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack . You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a 
                                 long rest.
         - Gift of the Sea: you gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can breathe underwater.
         - Oceanic Soul: you are now even more at home in the depths. You gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when you are fully submerged, any creature that is also fully submerged can understand your speech, and you 
                         can understand theirs.
         - Guardian Coil: your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and others, interposing itself between them and harm. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your 
                          reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage to that creature by 1d8. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage reduced by the tentacle increases to 2d8.
         - Grasping Tentacles: You learn the spell Black Tentacles. It counts as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can also cast it once without using a spell slot, and you 
                               regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. 
                               Moreover, damage can't break your concentration on this spell.
         - Fathomless Plunge: you can magically open temporary conduits to watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport yourself and up to five other willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl 
                              of tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 
                              feet of the others. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

            5th Level: Flame Strike, Greater Restoration
         - Bonus Cantrips: you learn the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.
         - Healing Light: you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. As a bonus 
                          action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). 
                          Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.
         - Radiant Soul: your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you add your Charisma 
                        modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.
         - Celestial Resistance: you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you
                                 can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
         - Searing Vengeance: the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant 
                              energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 
                              2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and is blinded until the end of the current turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
                              
                              
                              
   - - The Archfey Abilities:

            4th Level: Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility
            5th Level: Dominate Person, Seeming
         - Fey Presence: your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom 
                         saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature,
                         you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
         - Misty Escape: you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible
                         until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
         - Beguiling Defenses: your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your 
                               reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the 
                               creature takes any damage.
         - Dark Delirium: you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a 
                          failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes 
                          any damage. Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. You must 
                          finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
