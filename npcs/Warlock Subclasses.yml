   - - Lurker in the Deep Abilities:
       - Grasp of the Deep: you gain the ability to magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle
                            lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle. When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the
                            target takes 1d8 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage) and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the
                            damage dealt by the tentacle increases to 2d8. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack. You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to
                            your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
       - Lurker in the Deep Spells: Spell DC

          3rd: Lightning Bolt, Sleet Storm
          4th: Control Water, Evard’s Black Tentacles
          5th: Commune with Nature, Cone of Cold
       - Scion of the Deep: your patron accepts you into its inner court of servitors. You can telepathically communicate with any aberration, beast, elemental, or monstrosity that has an innate swimming speed, while it is 
                            within 120 feet of you. The creature can understand you and can respond telepathically.
       - Fathomless Soul: your patron grants you greater abilities. You gain the following benefits; 
                          - You can breathe both air and water.
                          - You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
                          - You gain resistance to cold damage.
       - Guardian Grasp: the tentacle you create with Grasp of the Deep can defend you and others. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of 
                         those creatures and reduce the damage to the chosen creature by half. After doing so, the tentacle vanishes.
       - Devouring Maw: you can magically draw forth a manifestation of your patron’s insatiable hunger. As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. For 1 minute, a translucent maw manifests in a 10-foot 
                        radius centered on that point. Each creature in that area when the maw appears must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained. Any creature that starts its turn in the
                        maw’s area takes 3d6 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage). As an action, a restrained creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the restraint on a success. At the start of 
                        your turn, if there is a creature in the maw’s area, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Unleash the Depths: you gain the ability to call upon your patron for aid. As an action, you choose a point within 30 feet of you where your patron tears through reality, manifesting a measure of its thalassic grandeur.
                             Choose one of the following effects to issue from this manifestation point. Once you use either effect, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
                             - Transport: You and up to five willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point are grasped by spectral tentacles and yanked through your patron’s realm. 
                                          The tentacles teleport you and the chosen creatures to a point of your choice within 100 miles that you have visited within the past 24 hours. The tentacles then vanish.
                             - Fury: You can direct a barrage of spectral tentacles to issue forth and strike up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point. Each target must make a Dexterity saving 
                                     throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 cold or lightning damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and
                                     is not knocked prone. The tentacles then vanish
   
   
                                     
   - - Noble Genie Abilities:
       - Collectors Vessel: Your patron gives you a magical vessel with which you can bind a creature to you and to your patron’s menagerie. The vessel is a Tiny object, and it is a spellcasting focus for you. You decide what 
                            the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Collector’s Vessel table.
                            Collector’s Vessel:
                            - d6 Vessel
                            -  1 Oil lamp
                            -  2 Urn
                            -  3 Ring with a compartment
                            -  4 Stoppered bottle
                            -  5 Hollow statuette
                            -  6 Ornate lantern
                            If you lose your vessel, you can perform a 1- hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous vessel. 
                            The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die. As an action while you are holding the vessel, you target a willing creature you can see within 100 feet of you and create a tether of 
                            wispy elemental material that links the target to you. The tether lasts for 1 hour, until you use this feature to create another tether, until the bound target is reduced to 0 hit points, or until 
                            the target ends its turn more than 100 feet from you. While you are tethered to a creature, you gain the following benefits;
                            - You gain a bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).
                            - When you can cast a spell, you can deliver the spell from your space or the bound creature’s space.
                            You can create the tether a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

          4th: Polymorph, Phantasmal Killer
          5th: Bigbys Hand, Creation
       - Elemental Resistance: Your patron grants you protection from an element. Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) until the end of your next long rest. 
                               While the tether of your Collector’s Vessel is active, the tethered creature gains resistance to the damage type you chose.
       - Protective Wish: you’re now able to use your Collector’s Vessel to wish for protection for yourself or your tethered creature. If you or the tethered creature is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to teleport, 
                          swapping places with the creature and switching which one of you is hit by the attack
       - Genies Entertainment: as an action, you can attempt to send a creature you can see within 90 feet to your patron’s court. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be 
                               magically drawn into your vessel and teleported to your patron’s court in the Elemental Planes. While there, the target is stunned and your patron marvels at the target with amusement but brings 
                               no harm to it. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, reappearing in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied on a success.
                               Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. If the target remains in your patron’s court for 1 minute, the genie sends the target back at the end of its turn as 
                               if it successfully saved, and you regain the use of this feature.
       - Collectors Call: in exchange for extending your patron’s influence over the multiverse, you can call on more of their power. As an action, you can implore your patron for aid by making a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
                          against your warlock spell save DC. If the check succeeds, you can choose one of the following effects;
                          - A creature you can see within 60 feet of you regains 8d6 hit points and ends one disease or condition afflicting it; blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
                          - A creature you can see within 60 feet of you has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
                          - You cast the Legend Lore spell without material components.
                          Whether the check succeeds or fails, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. Alternatively, you can regain the use of this feature by sacrificing nonmagical treasure worth at 
                          least 500 gp to your patron. This sacrifice requires the treasure to be within 10 feet of you for at least 1 minute, at the end of which you use an action to teleport the treasure to your patron’s realm,
                          provided you have the vessel of your Collector’s Vessel in hand.

       - Armor of Hexes: your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, 
                         regardless of its roll.
       - Master of Hexes: you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within

   - - The Raven Queen Abilities:
       - Raven Queen Spells: Spell DC
             1st Level: False Life, Sanctuary
             2nd Level: Silence, Spiritual Weapon
             3rd Level: Feign Death, Speak with Dead
             4th Level: Ice Storm, Locate Creature
             5th Level: Commune, Cone of Cold      
       - Sentinel Raven: you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give 
                         telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to 
                         Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can’t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it 
                         can’t take damage; and it is incapacitated. You can see through the raven’s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it
                         acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours. The raven doesn’t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you
                         from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you,
                         no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.
       - Soul of the Raven: you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven’s form. While merged, you become Tiny, you replace
                            your speed with the raven’s, and you can use your action only to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, or Search. During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. As
                            an action, you and the raven return to normal.
       - Ravens Shield: the Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing. You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the frightened condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.
       - Queens Right Hand: you can channel the Raven Queen’s power to slay a creature. You can cast Finger of Death. After you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
