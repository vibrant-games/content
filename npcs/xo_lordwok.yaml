# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Tortle Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Claws
    - content: Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an 
               unarmed strike.
    - title: Hold Breath
    - content: You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.
    - title: Natural Armor
    - content: Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this 
               number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.
    - title: Shell Defense
    - content: You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your 
               speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.
    - title: Survival Instinct
    - content: You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.  
       
  - title: Attacks
  - content: 1 attack with hand axe or claws
  - title: Combat Tactics
  - content: Xo is a pacifist and will avoid confrontation nearly at all costs.

    background-story: |
     Hailing from the far coasts, Xo grew up in a migratory tribe of wise tortles. This tribe obsessed over the kinds of blades and weapons that could possible harm them and, as such, developed their skills at crafting fine 
     weapons, grinding, and all trades associated with these processes. Xo was no different from the other members of his tribe, except that he is the only remaining son of it's chief. He remains in close contact with the other 
     members of his community but has realized that most of his tribe aspire to travel or to grow their skills and wealth. As the heir apparent, Xo realized he would have to take up the mantle of his tribe and advance their 
     interests. He seeks no such advancement but instead simply to 'get by'. The 'simple life'. This, to Xo, is more enjoyable. Particularly when one can help others and interact with the diverse array of peoples that frequent 
     a marketplace. He now operates primarily as a grinder and sells various accoutrements from his cart. These range from collectibles, like bells or miniatures, to pragmatic items, like pitons or adventuring packs.

    #
    personality: |
     Xo Is a laid back kinda guy. He does his best to avoid responsibility and prefers to just take things as they come. This attitude however, is not ideal in his father's eyes. As Chief, His father expects Xo to take over that
     role when he passes. Xo is not even marginally interested in succeeding his father and just wants to live a simple life doing his job, travelling around and meeting new people.
