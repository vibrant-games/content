    background-story: |
      <p>Hailing from the far coasts, Xo grew up in a migratory tribe of wise tortles. This tribe obsessed over the kinds of blades and weapons that could possible harm them and, as such, developed their skills at crafting fine weapons, grinding, and all trades associated with these processes.</p><p>Xo was no different from the other members of his tribe. Except that he is the only remaining son of the chief of his migratory tribe. He remains in close contact with the other members of his community but has realized that most of his tribe aspire to travel or to grow their skills and wealth. As the heir apparent, Xo realized he would have to take up the mantle of his tribe and advance their interests. He seeks no such advancement but instead simply to 'get by'. The 'simple life'. This, to Xo, is more enjoyable. Particularly when one can help others and interact with the diverse array of peoples that frequent a marketplace.</p><p>He now operates primarily as a grinder and sells various accoutrements from his cart. These range from collectibles, like bells or miniatures, to pragmatic items, like pitons or adventuring packs.</p>
