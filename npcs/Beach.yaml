# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Spartan in nature (but without the honorable intent) Orcish culture is well-known for its celebration of brute strength and denunciation of the more feminine side of an individual's nature. From birth, Beach, born 
      'Ukhtor', was smaller than his cohort and more inclined towards cleanliness and grace. As a baby he would cry and whine if exposed to violence or filth of any kind. Bullied and beaten often for what were perceived 
      as less 'Orcish' features, even as an infant, Ukhtor's mother feared for her son growing up in such a horrible environment. What's more, she was embarrassed to have produced such a creature. During one of the war-party's 
      treks between camps, she abandoned Ukhtor in a basket by a well-traveled road just outside of the party's planned travel path. Local constables were escorting magistrates between nearby towns and cam across the 
      basket. Peering inside, the head of the constabulary, Amin Carr, exclaimed, "cursed Orcs! They cannot even care for their own!" "Do away with the filthy runt!" One of the constables sneered. Amin peered into Ukhtor's 
      deep blues eyes and saw a nimble, dedicated soul; much different from the ferocious hatred he'd seen in his battles against raid-parties. "No," Amin exclaimed, "this one is different. 
      And we needn't fall victim to the same virulent hatred that afflicts the Orcs." Amin brought Ukhtor with him for the journey. Staring into his sea-blue eyes he pronounced that the youngster be named 'Beach'. 
      Raised within the Constabulary's ranks, Beach learned skills more akin to his natural abilities and became an agile killer. He was also imbued with their sense of noblility and respect.
