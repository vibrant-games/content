    background-story: |
      A shining son of the Sunmane Pride, Brygan is a fierce warrior, hunter and tracker. Specifically trained to hunt and defend against Hydras and Nxyborn creatures, he is vicious when battling them. He sees these things as abominations, affronts to his god and a threat to his pride. At home with his family, he is loving and gentle with his wife and cubs. He is a leader of his pride and heads up the scouting force. At times, especially while on the hunt, he can be very arrogant and sometimes gets too far ahead of his squad, getting himself into trouble.
