# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Bethondra (Beth) Dumas is one of the more prominent and revered of the Dumas family's seemingly endless pool of "cousins". Like most of the "cousins", no one in nor outside of the family (excepy maybe the family patron)
      really seems to know what her lineage nor her parentage are, but she is a cousin all the same. While still taking orders from and serving the interests of the family and their Master, Beth has always been an Ascetic,
      seeking quiet, peace and solitude. This is primarily because of her incredibly sensative hearing. Loud noises physically hurt, and while in groups of larger tha 6 or 7 people will generally wear some form of ear protection.
      Beth lives alone in the deep woods but will always answer the call of her family. Primarily she only takes her orders from Nicodeamus, but due to her asceticism and withdrawn, studious nature also feels a stong kinship
      with her "uncle" Mordecai and has been known to spend hours or even days in quiet contemplation with him in his library. However, when it comes to fighting she is a fierce combatant, lightning fast and incredibly strong
      and ferocious.

    personality: |
      Beth Dumas is a giant of a woman, standing over 7' tall, heavily muscled with thick green grey skin. She wears little in the way of clothing and has a huge mop of black hair in various braids and clumps. She is quiet and 
      soft-spoken but a ferocious warrior. She would much rather be left alone in quiet contemplation but will absolutely fight with fevered abandon when she's called upon by her family
