# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Golomir was raised in a traditional Orcish war tribe. Bored of and disenfranchised by his tribe's incessant pressure to train and their unquenchable thirst for the blood of their foes, Golomir sought deeper meaning for
      his life. The Shaman of his tribe, an Orog, held sacred texts that detailed rituals for contacting the population of the Feywild. Golomir gained her favor and studied these texts until he was finally able to contact the
      practitioners of the archfey.Golomir gained access to the fey realms and wandered there, befriending many of its denizens and adopting their medicines, attitudes, magicks, and lore. He grew his talents as a forager of
      medicinal herbs and a practitioner of critical care. What's more, he adopted the archfey practice of creating bobbles and dolls to represent that which he believes to be good in the world. Over time, while the Seelie
      taught him the ways of the wild in both the mortal and fey realms, Golomir gradually grew the curled ram horns that distinguish him from the rest of the members of the Orcish race.He now splits his time between the two
      realms wandering with the aim of bringing joy to those he meets. Well known for his abilities as a 'cunning man' or 'hedge wizard', a sort of shamanic voodoo medicine practitioner, he believes that joy and the greater
      good is only achievable through spreading health and literacy.
