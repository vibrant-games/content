    background-story: |
      Golomir was raised in a traditional Orcish war tribe. Bored of and disenfranchised by his tribe's incessant pressure to train and their unquenchable thirst for the blood of their foes, Golomir sought deeper meaning for his life. The Shaman of his tribe, an Orog, held sacred texts that detailed rituals for contacting the population of the Feywild. Golomir gained her favor and studied these texts until he was finally able to contact the practitioners of the archfey.Golomir gained access to the fey realms and wandered there, befriending many of its denizens and adopting their medicines, attitudes, magicks, and lore. He grew his talents as a forager of medicinal herbs and a practitioner of critical care. What's more, he adopted the archfey practice of creating bobbles and dolls to represent that which he believes to be good in the world. Over time, while the Seelie taught him the ways of the wild in both the mortal and fey realms, Golomir gradually grew the curled ram horns that distinguish him from the rest of the members of the Orcish race.He now splits his time between the two realms wandering with the aim of bringing joy to those he meets. Well known for his abilities as a 'cunning man' or 'hedge wizard', a sort of shamanic voodoo medicine practitioner, he believes that joy and the greater good is only achievable through spreading health and literacy.
