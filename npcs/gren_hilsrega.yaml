    combat-tactics: |
      Gren is not to be underestimated. He is a fierce combatant. He will almost exclusively slowly draw back from melee and allow his guards to fill in the ranks while he casts vicious spells from not far away.
    special-equipment:
    - <p><b>Cloak of Protection +3</b></p><b>Staff of Defense</b></p>
<i>Staff
    - simple weapon
    - melee weapon
    - rare (requires attunement)
3 lb.</p><p>1d6 bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)</p></i><p>
This slender
    - hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells.

While holding the staff
    - you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

The staff has 10 charges
    - which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand
    - you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class's spell list: mage armor (1 charge) or shield (2 charges). No components are required.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge
    - roll a d20. On a 1
    - the staff shatters and is destroyed.

Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>With nothing but selfish goals, Wureok joined the local guild of Magic Arts and, with his exceptional cunning and charisma, worked his way into an internship with the castellan at the time. Using his raw magicks and ability to influence others, he ousted the castellan by convincing the noble family they served that he was an imposter - a foreigner looking to undermine their power.</p> <p>Gaining the trust of the royals over decades and generations, Wureok has, at least on the surface, appeared to be an exemplary court official. He watches over the castle and surrounding villas with great attention to detail; especially when it comes to collecting taxes and scutage.</p><p>Wureok has organized a growing rebel faction among the peasants and townsfolk, using the pressures he himself applies to turn them against his benefactor, then twisting the stories of uprisings in reports to his benefactor. He thereby presents further reason for his position, for the further exploitation of the common-folk, and for the royal family to further insulate themselves from the outside world.</p>
