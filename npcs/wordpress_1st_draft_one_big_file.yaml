    special-abilities: |
      Corrora's worship of Lenterra and in depth study of Arcana helped him learn some Wizard Cantrips: Blade Ward, Control Flames, Firebolt, and 1st level Wizard spells including magic missile
      |
      8th level spellcaster
      |
      When Corrora is reduced to half of his hitpoints in a battle, there is a 1 in 10 chance that his body will be taken over by the spirit of one of his ancestors, temporarily increasing his strength, dexterity, and constitution to 18, adding 40 temporary hit points, entering a rage state, and removing his spellcasting capabilities. Corrora makes a Charisma saving throw at the end of each round. A success allows him to regain control of his body
    attacks: |
      Dawnbringer +3 to attack, 1d8+2 damage, additional 2d4 damage to undead
      |
      Spellcasting: firebolt, magic missile, banishment
    combat-tactics: |
      Corrora prefers to use his arsenal of ranged attack spells whenever possible. As a warcaster, he is able to carry his shield and either a war hammer or longsword to defend himself from enemies who get too close
      |
      Corrora will be the first to rush to the aid of fallen allies. He'll drag them to safety and use his healing spells to save them
    special-equipment:
    - Corrora rescued a sentient Sun Blade named Dawnbringer from a crypt of demonic worshippers and claimed a Warhammer of Warning as treasure after successfully capturing a soldier who had gone rogue and kidnapped the son of a wealthy merchant and bringing him to justice

    # The long form character development.

    # Required.

    #
    background-story: |
      The son of Yakahe's human ambassador to the High-Elves of Silverleaf and a Elven diplomat, Corrora had it all as a child and young man. Intelligent and athletic, he excelled on the training field and under the tutelage of the local sages who taught the children of minor Nobles in his home; the city of Baraithton.</p>
      |
      <p>As an adolescent, Corrora began to have extremely vivid nightmares of himself committing terrible, violent acts. The nightmares progressed to the point where the previously gregarious nobleman's son turned sullen and dour. The lack of sleep caused him to be irritable, constantly snapping at his family, his tutors, and his friends. The feeling of isolation only made the problem worse. The nightmares because more violent, more vivid, and more frequent the more withdrawn he became. 
      |
      One day the nightmares became reality. A skirmish with his younger brother, Yarith ended in bloodshed. While wrestling, Corrora blacked out. When he came to his senses, he was holding a sharpened shard of rock with his Yarith's blood dripping from it and his brother's limp body beneath him. Dropping the stone in horror, Corrora was touched by the Goddess Lenterra (Goddess of arcane knowledge) for the first time. He could feel her hand reaching through him as he cradled his Yarith's head in his lap. A soft glowing light encompassed them both. And, Yarith breathed.</p>
      |
      <p>That night, and for several nights after, Corrora had the same dream: he was floating above his body watching as his eyes became red with a hint of flickering fire followed by him reaching for a rock and slashing Yarith's throat with it.</p>
      |
      <p>This was not the last time something like this happened to Corrora.</p>
      |
      <p>At the suggestion of Lenterra, Corrora began to deepen his study of the arcane and religion in search of a cure for his condition. His natural curiosity lent itself to him becoming a renowned expert in arcane and ancient religious phenomenon. This research led him to discover that the Elvish side of his heritage held some deep ancient secrets. A number of his ancestors had committed despicable acts millenia ago. The acts they committed were the very acts he dreams about so vividly. The ancestors were the very ancestors who's spirits overcame his body when under too much stress from imminent danger.</p>
      |
      <p>Corrora is constantly in search of a way to rid himself from his ancestor's curse. This search is what originally brought him to Eberston and the Yakahe frontier far from his family. </p>

    background-story: |
      Steve grew up working the streets, fighting and stealing to survive. He's an accomplished pickpocket and in his youth had a reputation as a break-in specialist. He's an angry cold-blooded fellow who has no qualms about stabbing first and asking questions later. As he aged, he became less adept at execution and worked more on the planning side of robberies. One time his greed got the better of him and he betrayed his allies on a job. As punishment, the Thieve's Guild took his eye, stripped him of his responsibilities for planning jobs and stuck him behind the bar at the tavern that hides their secret hall. He's basically a glorified doorman for the guild and he resents every second of it. He does however, have a permanent reminder to not betray the guild again. He's mean and doesn't care for serving customers at all, he gets paid whether anyone is drinking or not. He keeps a hand crossbow behind the bar and a dagger on his belt in case any trouble makes it past the security outside the door

    background-story: |
      <p>Thane hails from the brewing town of Hemmelweist [Village/Town] in remote hills nestled within the vast mountain range of SimmeredAshes [Mountain Range]. His community were very kinship focused and taught him the value of offering hearth and home to those people among whom one lives. Cared for by multiple different members of this closeknit community, he gained a deep love for the 'commoner' - he or she that partakes in those daily activities that support a group and form its foundational infrastructure. He thusly also learned the various skillsets that complement such a vision: brewing, cooking, textile work. Creating fabulous rare brews of mountain apples and deephops or lush woven fabrics for bed linens and window dressings; these were the lively activities that colored his youth.</p>However, these beautiful products were being created during a time when neighboring mountain Dwarven cities, such as Kindlebrough and Cynd [Dwarven cities], and various Human settlements in the Eastern Plains [Broad Settled Expanse] were suffering from hunger and poverty. This wondrous pallette of the best aspects of Dwarven culture was suddenly disrupted after a pact was struck upon between these two communities - a pact for mutual expansion. A collective response was required from Thane's tribe and an aristocracy quickly formed as the village leaders were overcome with panic and sudden greed. Quickly rising in power, this group condensed to a few self-appointed leaders. They became tyrants in a matter of months, enforcing impossible laws that led to austere and deprived conditions. Families were broken and scattered. Vowing to one day return and bring his people back to their glory, Thane fled for weeks searching for a civilization within which to begin his life anew and share the ethical codes of his people with the world at large.</p>Thane's inborn work ethic gained traction with village markets and it wasn't long before he had accrued enough coin to begin planning to return to his people. His connections to the people with whom he resettled excite him at the potential that he will not return to his home alone.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p> Hilltop [Village; Town] is a quiet halfling town located on a well-used trade route. This has conditioned the population to become diverse in their skillsets and relatively wealthy overall - compared to other halfling settlements. With all the coming and going of people and voluminous exchange of coins, goods, and services, people can get lost. When people get lost and nobody comes looking for you, well, then what do you do? A lecherous and ornery halfling grain and feed merchant from the nearby economic centre of Invasaad [Major City] was traveling through Hilltop with his "best employees", his three young daughters. The girls would heave the sacks of grain and feed on and off the cart or sometimes would be responsible for interacting with immediate buyers. In one transaction, the feed had been hauled onto the buyer's cart whilst Stella - the youngest of the 3 sisters - was bargaining for the first time with a crotchety old woman who couldn't afford to feed her goats. </p><p>"I'll give ya two silver, nothin more! My husband has passed and we 'ad no children. I'm left to me own devices! 'Ave pity on an old lady". </p><p>Remembering how her father would deal abusively with her sisters whenever they returned with less than he expected, Stella continued to bargain. In the meanwhile, her father, who had grown tired of feeding a third child and who had resigned himself to cutting down the weakest buffalo, had carried on in the cart out of town. Stella continued to barter, none the wiser, until the argumentative customer wouldn't budge. She looked back for her father's approval and saw no cart, no father, no sisters. Stella ended the barter, panicked. She raced around town thinking that her father had other dealings. He was nowhere to be found. Young Stella wept in the square.</p><p>Eventually that evening a kind elderly halfling woman approached the weeping figure. She comforted her. Told her their were bigger problems. Bigger problems that needed solutions. The kind elderly halfling lady told Stella, "you're from where you choose to be from. You can be Stella of Hilltop". The name stuck and Stella quickly became a surrogate child to the people of Hilltop. Her father never did return.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p> Lorne was raised in the SimmeredAshes [Large Mountain Range] Mountain range. His parents were devout worshippers of Hysdomman, the Father of Shields [Any powerful Central Dwarven God] and highly traditional. They were harsh on him, but fair, and always urged him to keep his hands busy in his own business, not others. As talented and renown smiths, his family were also able to offer Lorne a lush and more-than-comfortable lifestyle. He thus absorbed and internalized the priority of wealth and proprietorship.</p><p>Although among the upper class of his city, Lorne had watched his parents relentless toiling upon the anvils and forges. He learned that comfort is the result of long days of tireless labour. As his parents aged he began to take the roles of proprietor and designer of Stronghammer Arms. To this day, he swears by his name and lives for his brand</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Ezio’s people were a cult who worshipped one of the Great Old Ones, a Forgotten God. His family chose this because they witnessed the fascist matriarchical hierarchy of Lollth [Or similar Evil Drow God]. Alongside this, the tribe heard rumors and saw evidence that the Great Old Ones were on the rise to reclaim their positions of power over the material and astral planes. The great Jackal Irrt, the Lord of Hunger, Thirst, Famine, and Drought, and Moander, the Lord of Growth and Decay [Two Forgotten Gods] are separately surging forward into the hearts and minds of those in the underdark and those few clans who wander the middle-ground between the upperworld and the Underdark. Disaffected with fascist rulers, Ezio's tribe rejected and became fervent enemies of the ruling pantheons of the Underdark. Learning of the power and promise of the Forgotten Gods, Ezio's clan began offering faith and tithings to Ommen-Hurr [A different Forgotten God], the goddess of Shadow and Time.</p><p>Because of their growing size and relative power, other apostatic clans who followed other Old Gods became violent towards Ezio's tribe. One fateful night, the followers of Irrt summoned aspects of the deity to the material realm to strike. Massive jackals with gnashing teeth and almost rotted skin hanging loosely from their frames were unleashed on Ezio's village.</p><p>Demon hounds descended on the Underground city of Daur’zzwth (Dar-zooth) [or any Drow or Underdark village] that Ezio and his people called home. One of these great demon hounds sought out Ezio’s father and uncle especially, invaded their home, and assaulted the family. Ezio’s father, Ziirr’kho (Zee-rick-oh) and uncle Ras’klnn (Raz-kill- non) bravely fought the beast, bringing it near death, yet both Drow heroes were left close to death themselves. A young Ezio, terrified and protecting the youth in the basement of the home, silently dashed out of the cellar trap-door to grasp his father’s powerful shortsword. The demon hound circled, smelling victory, and, due to injury and pride, did not sense Ezio lurking in the shadows around the outside of the room. Drooling and snapping its jaws in naïve glee, the beast slowly approached the two men. Ezio leapt from the shadows and sunk the blade deep into the beasts eye, killing it. He’s since been a family hero. The tribe has taken it upon themselves to train him as an Assassin and Diplomat and send him forth into the Upperworld to cause chaos and make way for their rise to power.</p>

      <p>Growing up as the son of a poor farmer can be hard as it is. Add alcoholism, abuse, and lecherous behaviors and you have the ingredients for an exploitative upbringing rife with imparted dysfunctional behaviors. Tristeth learned to put his focus on what he could control: whether or not small animals would live or die.</p><p>As this trope would suggest, Tristeth began with the family cat. He then began picking off birds with his slingshot. He would carefully examine these animals inside and out, learning their morphologies and organic composition. He would often bury the parts separately in what he, arbitrartily, deemed to be the "right spot".</p><p>Nobody ever really found out about his little hobby. He covered it up well by always having a variety of pets that he cared for. Eventually, Tristeth came of age where he had to choose between laboring on his father's farm or venturing out on his own to pursue a different trade. The choice wasn't hard. He hated living there, as much as he adored a few of his 7 brothers and sisters. He departed to a nearby village and volunteered for the coroner of the religious order of Selune [Any Moon or Good Goddess] and learned various respectful means of preparing bodies for burial or pyre. Because this religious Order preached the sanctity of bodies and spirits, he also began changing his overall attitude and strange hobbies. Eventually he worked his way into the position of gravekeeper for the Order and currently presides over their countryside sacred burial grounds. He and his one bastard son, abandoned by his mother, reside in the small townhouse next to the burial grounds.</p>[Optional] Tristeth is being exploited by Duergar Warlocks looking to sacrifice the bodies in the burial ground to an Evil Deity. Consequently, they have penetrated his mind and begun causing a sort of madness where Tristeth escapes to an astral realm that he calls, "the Chalk". The Warlocks essentially send his astral form to wander an endless expanse of near nothingness; only faint and fading chalk outlines of reality. In the chalk, he is faced with the spirits of those the Warlocks seek to sacrifice next. The victim convinces Tristeth to continue his supply of bodies. He then wakes, exhausted and wondering why sleep no longer provides him rest. He's begun talking to himself and exhibiting odd twitches and spasms due to exhaustion.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Long escaped from the control of Mind Flayers, Zirrash'ka and his tribe also fled the plane of Limbo [Any non-material plane] and integrated themselves among villages of elves on the rim of known civilization. Quietly keeping to themselves and continuting their gratitude towards their patrons, his tribe thirsted for knowledge of the material plane. They formed a monastic tradition that offered worship and tithing to Jegel, the God of Scribes and Depositioner of the Passed (Or any Deity overlooking the passing of the living to the Dead). They pledged to keep track of all those denizens that once lived, how they lived, and when, how, where, and why they died. Over the decades they developed an advanced library and monastary, training their monks in the value of knowledge, gratitude, courage, and direct action.</p>

      <p>Aspiring to be the Fountainhead of Clax, the High Duergar God of Pestilence and Destruction, Mammoon will stop at nothing to incarnate herself as the ultimate High Priestess; clad in the bones of a thousand dead, each bone tied to the next with the flesh of a thousand more.</p><p>Mammoon's aspirations come from her abuse at the hands of a former spouse. Married young and corralled into the traditional power positions of a Duergar wife, Mammoon sought power over everything else and would be ruthless in this pursuit. She sought the faith of her village, the surrounding region, and eventually the Underdark. Vying for a position as Loxxed Priestess, comparable to a magistrate, Mammoon watched as her competitor gained greater and greater favor. This favor grew as her competitor finally had a child. This Duergard tribe had a particularly hard time reproducing and this was a sign from their God. Not only did she face ongoing abuse from her husband about her barren womb, Mammoon now faced imminent defeat in her pursuit of power.</p><p>As the almost Spartan culture would allow, Mammoon snatched the child from its bed and brought it to the center idol of Clax, ringing the town bell. Many of her tribe flooded the streets to watch Mamoon sacrifice the child in offering to Clax. The statue reached down, scooped up the body, and consumed it violently. Mammoon was then imbued with an overwhelming sense that she was destined for greater things. She denounced the tribe in an animal growl and fled the Underdark in search of greater sacrifices to Clax. Seeing such violence in sacrifice has become her primary goal.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>In the town of Barrelheist [Seaside town or city] people are always astir because of the constant influx of supply and trade ships and the endless queue of traders and merchants hoping to be the first to acquire exotic goods. When the diaspora of hill Gnomes of Aznmott [Distant and Disappeared Gnomish City] were driven from their home by a string of massive experiments gone awry, they arrived to settle among the hills and valleys surrounding Barrelheist. These gnomes were instinctively drawn to the tradeport and quickly began to make up a large proportion of the population. Among this growing frontier shanty marketplace grew a remarkably talented gnome who shows great promise with steam technology, Kaz Lamosatzi.</p><p>Kaz' family was unorthodox in all possible ways. They rarely had a stable home and instead would simply have meeting spaces where they would reconvene after hard-working days of scavenging for materials to develop their steam inventions. What's more, the family unit was not traditional and instead consisted of non-hierarchical extended family and friends. Family structure is so diffuse among these Hill Gnomes that it's rare a member can identify a proper 'mother' or 'father'. Instead they are most drawn to whatever individual inspires invention!</p><p>Kaz cultivated his capacity for invention and steam technology and his gadgets gained popularity among the sailors and merchants of Barrelheist. Always chipper and looking for the good in things, Kaz successfully disguises a certain disdain for wealthy people that he acquired living much like an urchin in a shanty town frequented by the noble and affluent.

      <p> The jungle trading port of Ambor Maala [Any Mixed Race Trading port in a jungle environment] was host to most of the races of the realms and, alongside this, most of the arcane magicks and knowledges one would expect from a diverse population. This vibrant locale held within its confines a collection of written lore that is well known even beyond the region. Keepers of this knowledge are revered. A modest and composed Firbolg named Wesley Palaxian had gained esteem as head keeper of these lore and the large volume of tomes within which the knowledges were held.</p><p>One fateful afternoon the library of Ambor Maala was invaded by a small group of elite Drow Soldiers and their commander, a powerful evocation/transmutation mage of the Underdark seeking greater knowledges of the arcane that were contained within the library. Wesley was far from a warrior of any sorts but knew that in the wrong hands these knowledges would prove destructive for his home town and beyond. Valiantly defending the library, Wesley was mortally wounded. During what he believed were his final breaths he confidently cursed the Drow and their leader.</p><p><i>"Foolish furbag,"<i>the Drow mage condesdendingly muttered unimpressed. <i>"There is clearly nothing you can do to stop us. Might as well be a monkey following the filthy jungle peoples you hold so dear."</i>The mage uttered some mystical incantation in Drow and traced sigils in the air, transforming Wesley into an Orangutan. The invaders then proceeded to ignite the shelves of books in the library before fleeing through a teleportation portal.</p><p>The local guard attended the blaze and brought it under control but Wesley had already pulled himself from the blaze. Ashamed to ever show himself to anyone in his home town, he slowly retreated into the jungle. For days, Wesley sought out the Sylvan Elven Druids he knew inhabited the surrounding jungles. Eventually found by these kinds souls, Wesley was no longer able to communicate besides pointing to himself and shouting, 'Ook!. When the Druids found him reading through their tomes during his recovery, they recognized that this 'monkey' was beyond ordinary. They chose to transport him to the High Elven City of Emnius [A Major Elven City] fo study. The Elves of Emnius were able to determine that Ook was a victim of magicks but the polymorph spell was of unknown origin to them and they weren't able to trace the magic to uncover his original form. They quickly came to see Ook's ability to categorize and organize tomes of knowledge and appointed him as assistant to their keeper of archives and knowledge. Ook has since become renown throughout the surrounding regions.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The hillside Dusk Goblins of Akhlo-Meek [Any major Goblin Village] remain relatively peaceful and rarely disrupt humanoid settlements beyond the hills. They are however plagued by raids from Underdark Goblins that emerge from the surrounding caves. These raids pose a serious threat, particularly because they result in captives being taken and enslaved. The Mountain Goblins aretactical in so far as they specifically target youth with the intention of converting them to following the increasingly violent and hate-fueled Goblinoid Deity Kyhaergebaerg [Any aggressive Goblinoid God]. Yeet was raised in this environment, inculcated with hatred for humanoid races and a desire to spill their blood, ravage their townships, and steal their shiny things.</p><p>Yeet might have been captured at the right time for conversion and subjected to viscious and violent 'therapies', but he is still able to remember that he is a Dusk goblin. He's able to reflect on an upbringing that promoted brotherhood and stability. Nonetheless, he has still been infused with the hatred and bloodlust that characterizes Underdark Goblins. He is characterized by this dissonance.</p><p>Drawn into a raid of purportedly magical Dwarven caves by a tyrannical hobgoblin, Herkog, Yeet played a lieutenant role in controlling the captured Dwarves and staving off any intruders. Yet the mission went amiss when a group of adventurers from the nearby frontier town of Rheidolen [Any small frontier town] were comissioned to clear the caves and interrogate Herkog about his connections to the violent raids on surrounding towns. Herkog was slain and the goblin population eliminated. Except for Yeet. Because Herkog was slain before he could be questioned, this party of adventurers questioned Yeet instead. Yeet broke down and told them of how he is a Dusk Goblin and should never have been involved in this affair. He begged or his life and gave the adventuring party more than enough information to continue on with achieving their objectives. He was escorted back to Rheidolen for questioning and a potential trial but, because of the lack of security and organization in this frontier town, it was easy for such a crafty Goblin to escape. He now roams the wilderness and distant towns seeking other dusk Goblins.</p>

      <p>Raised in the remote Hill Dwarf lumber town of Gontor Rains [any Dwarven village], Babs was always the target of particularly lecherous laborers after their long days of work in the hillside forests and at the mill. Even as a young-un, she realized she had a knack for drawing the gaze of most peoples. A local smithy took a particular liking to her as she blossomed into her 'tween years and he would spend countless hours at his forge crafting a unique suit of Dwarven mail just for her.</p><p>Once completed, the smith gifted the mail to Babs with the hope that it would win her favor. Instead, it gained the interest of the males in the community who insisted that their small town enter Babs into chain-model contests in the nearby Dwarven city of Queldon [Any Dwarven City]. Needless to say, Babs' subconscious psionics began to mature as she drew the gaze of all kinds of traveling merchants and emissaries. Her career as a model began with a resounding, 'bang!'</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Spartan in nature (but without the honorable intent) Orcish culture is well-known for its celebration of brute strength and denunciation of the more feminine side of an individual's nature. From birth, Beach, born 'Ukhtor', was smaller than his cohort and more inclined towards cleanliness and grace. As a baby he would cry and whine if exposed to violence or filth of any kind.</p><p>Bullied and beaten often for what were perceived as less 'Orcish' features, even as an infant, Ukhtor's mother feared for her son growing up in such a horrible environment. What's more, she was embarrassed to have produced such a creature. During one of the war-party's treks between camps, she abandoned Ukhtor in a basket by a well-traveled road just outside of the party's planned travel path.</p><p>Local constables were escorting magistrates between nearby towns and cam across the basket. Peering inside, the head of the constabulary, Amin Carr, exclaimed, <i>"cursed Orcs! They cannot even care for their own!"</i></p><p><i> "Do away with the filthy runt!"</i> One of the constables sneered. </p>Amin peered into Ukhtor's deep blues eyes and saw a nimble, dedicated soul; much different from the ferocious hatred he'd seen in his battles against raid-parties. <i>"No,"</i> Amin exclaimed, <i>"this one is different. And we needn't fall victim to the same virulent hatred that afflicts the Orcs."</i></p><p>Amin brought Ukhtor with him for the journey. Staring into his sea-blue eyes he pronounced that the youngster be named 'Beach'. Raised within the Constabulary's ranks, Beach learned skills more akin to his natural abilities and became an agile killer. He was also imbued with their sense of noblility and respect.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Hunted for transgressions against the Preistesses of Lollth [Any Drow Deity], Coalwater's family fled the Underdark and largely dispersed among the denizens of the Upperworld with the hope that they would remain out of the purview of their viscious condemners. Consequently, Coalwater was raised among the many races but conditioned to remain largely out of sight. Their family was constantly plagued with the anxiety of being found or sold out and, as such, spent a great deal of energy ensuring that their homesteads and places of business were non-descript and secure from prying eyes. Coalwater picked up on the many innovative techniques that their family would use to secure themselves from potential intrusions.</p><p>As they matured, Coalwater would occasionally wander the market freely yet subtly, spying for goods or peoples who might help them better secure their homestead. It was during one of these outings that they connected with a few roughshod members of the local Thieves' Guild. Quickly becoming friends over conversations about locks and tools, these three youth began to investigate means of overcoming the security of local businesses and magistrates. Calling it 'troubleshooting', they would often come into conflict with the local guards and militia. It was during these brief skirmishes that the three youth decided they would take it upon themselves to contract their skills and knowledge to the local elite with the slogan, 'Three Geese that will honk yer horn - If we can blow it, it need be reborn'.</p>

      <p>The bustling multi-racial city of Everskaard [Any major multi-racial city] is famous for it's innovative mercantile classes and its capacities for importing and exporting goods of all kinds from throughout the region. The craftspeople of Everskaard never relent to traditional ways of fashioning goods and instead inspire one another, with their fervent work ethics and near constant invention, to recreate the ways that things get made. Rainbow is an exemplar of these ideals.</p><p>While their lineage is that of smiths, Rainbow abandoned metals and forges in favor of finding ways in which to weave together hides and woods to be just as sturdy and effective as irons and steels. She operates as a very unorthodox 'Smithy', heating woods and hids in her alternate style forge to bend and shape and harden them into innovative, light, and durable armors and weapons.</p>

      <p>Sylvan Elves aren't limited to a certain locale. In fact, being animistic, many tribes have aligned themselves with particular facets of the wild. Nokumi's tribe, self-entitled that Nation of Nac Mac, have settled throughout the tributaries and banks of the great Thaad River [Any Grand River] and exemplify how the spirituality of the Sylvan Elves has diversified and refined itself to various aspects of the wilderness. They are a nomadic peoples whose patterns resemble that of a tiger around these flowing fingers of water. They draw their shamanic energies and histories of lore from the ecology and happenings that constitute the rapids and still bodies that make up the area.</p><p>Although their culture focuses on these waters, their knowledge of nature and the region is far from limited by it. They are expert guides and trackers. Nokumi is no exception. She can lead most travelers to almost anywhere in the region through easy or difficult terrain, often showing her patrons short cuts or means of survival. Her entourage of pets are more akin to friends who follow her in return for her love and kindness. They are all almost attuned to one another as an arcane caster might be attuned to her familiar.</p><p>Eschewing most material wealth, as is custom for her peoples, Nokumi will often only accept tools or clothing in return for her guidance.</p>

      <p>The remote frontier towns of Errk, Cloh, and Mont Ire, are closely interconnected shanty-style communities within a short travel from one another amidst the mountainous pseudo-desert landscapes of the Eves of Tomorrow [any semi-Wasteland area]. They are close enough to have established a makeshift government and militia. A much needed pact to manage the roving bands of marauders and various monstrosities that populate the wastes.</p><p>Rahim grew up in this challenging environment and wed his sweetheart, Mallum. The two have made a name for themselves as propritors of one of the finest rest stops in the region where they offer some of the finest consumables around, serving fine grub and wines and, with their deep cellar, one of the few purveyors of flavored ices for hundreds of miles</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Wendy Gol was born to farmers in the village of Eldwynn [A small Human settlement] in the plans of Overmarsh Gale [Any broad plain of rich, fertile soil]. Having a humble and challenging upbringing as the youngest of 3 brothers and 4 sisters, Wendy sought the recognition of both parents, even when she married a well-respected farmer's son from an adjacent farm. Her longing for love and attention was never fulfilled and, as might be expected, Wendy was treated much like an employee of the farm and as a child by her husband. This lack of recognition and attention was so profound that Wendy would often wander towards the sparse woods nearby which she heard from her siblings contained caves and steppes that were home to covens of witches who were known to wield great magicks. Her mundane life drove her to the excitement of trying to uncover where this coven was hiding.</p><p>Upon her 21st birthday, recieving no celebrations, Wendy made her usual trip to the woods nearby. Upon entering the shade of the canopies she heard a whisper in the back of her mind. <i>"We are here. We have been watching. You are welcome, sister."</i>Shocked and elated, Wendy drove deeper into the woods until she came upon a chipped and cracked carving out of the steppe wall surrounded by entageled roots and vines.</p><p>A beautiful elven face slowly advanced from the darkness of the cave and into the light. Smiling, the Elven woman said, <i>"Welcome, sister. We have been waiting"</i> and she gently beckoned Wendy to enter the cave.</p><p>Wendy cautiously entered the cave which was populated by 4 beautiful elven women dressed in wondrous garments standing around a fire. The four held hands to form a circle, yet leaving one spot open. <i>"Come girl"</i>, one said, <i>"find your true place in this world".</i> Wendy joined the circle and was suddenly filled with a surge of disgust, hatred, and bilious discontent. <i>"We pledge to thee, dear Wendy, that you will never be ignored again!"</i>At this moment, Wendy's husband, who had been following her into the woods for sometime to investigate what his wife was up to, burst into the cave. <i>"You vile creatures, leave her be!"</i>He shouted. Cackling, the coven charmed the young man and demanded that Wendy consume him with them if she were to truly become something more than a farmer's daughter. Having been charmed herself, Wendy followed their demands. Cackling as Wendy's once beautful appearance withered into that of an old, wicked had, the coven surged in a circle of blue and green electrical ethereal energy that concluded with a blast of light centered upon Wendy who promptly squatted and laid an egg. The coven cackled in concert yet again as the egg hatched and a chick stumbled forth with a head that was an exact replica of her husband. One member of the coven snatched the fleeing chick and forced it down Wendy's throat, crying in a crackled voice, <i>"henceforth you will be Wendigola, she who lost her beauty to her longing..."</i></p><p>Reluctantly reborn and recognizing she hadn't gained the power and comradery she had expected, Wendigola fled the cave as the coven's cackling slowly faded away among the interstices of the steppes and trees.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>When the village of Everskinnis [Any Elven village] was raided by Ogres and goblinoids, the inevitable results of the plunder and pillage was that the ravaged female escapees would birth half-breeds. Relima Haas, a young woman and former wife of a fine hunter who fell in the raids, was among these poor women. The gestation period was more than draining and the birth fatal. Scarback was born.</p><p>Scavenging for food and other sustenance and forced to reform their beliefs and direction, the camp of survivors raised Scarback in the wilderness. He learned to value the spirits of the wild beasts and flora. He also learned the value of connecting with the rage he felt over the abuses imparted upon his mother and her now scattered community of hunters.</p><p>A small portion of these survivors refused to live in survival-mode and instead departed together to seek a better life. Scarback followed. The 5 departees were the smarter and more talented of the group. One of these departees was a beautiful young elven woman named Bodius towards whom Scarback took a serious liking.</p><p>Traveling village to village, they would perform feats of strength and agility for coins to wrangle up food or drink. In time, they came to be known as an entertaining side-show. On one fateful night, the group encountered a particularly vicious pack of gnolls. Scarback fought valiantly while most of the group were slain. The gnolls plundered what they could and fled while Scarback was left tending to a seriously wounded Bodius with tears in his eyes.</p><p>"Scarback love pretty elf-lady", he lamented.</p><p>He tucked Bodius in the group's steamer chest and gently fed her, gave her water, and tended to her wounds as he made his way to the nearest township. Upon next opening the steamer, Bodius was somewhat recovered and attempted to get out.</p><p>"No. Elf lady not safe", Scarback proclaimed as he knocked her out with a back hand. He tied her up securely, stuffed cloth in her mouth, and closed the chest, determined to keep Bodius safe from harm. Yet, that same day, when he made his way through town his mind encountered a serious psychological schism; he couldn't accept what he'd done and immediately began searching for Bodius. At the same time he has an inexorable bond with his steamer trunk. Twice daily, in private, he will check on his belongings and only then recognize that Bodius remains in the chest. He will feed her and provide her water, only to Bind and gag her and lock the steamer back up.</p>

      <p>Eleanorious hails from a regal clan of golden Dragonborn who have integrated themselves well into the ruling population of the region. The Murr family, especially, have developed meaningful emotional and economic relationships within Xhontapys [Major Trade City] and positioned themselves well as purveyors of finer goods within its trade nexus.</p><p>With a knack for measuring volumes by eye and comprehending chemical reactions prior to mixing ingredients, Eleanorious trained with various local phylacteries and alchemists to learn this remarkable trade. She has become well-known for her expertise as well as her pleasant personality, fine work-ethic, and her good fashion sense.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Wandering through the woods, Cal Manterius realized that he had no idea where he was or where he was going. The brain fog imposed by that Green Hag who was haunting his village lingered. <i>Was there a hag? What village?</i> Cal's mind tumbled through what he thought were memories but wouldn't stop tumbling. He was getting dizzy. <i>Stop tumbling!</i> He cried out in his mind.</p><p>He stumbled into a clearing in the woods where ruined buildings from a long razed village jutted out of the landscape like giant skeletal fingers reaching for the freedom of the sky. <i>Is this where I was headed?</i> Cal looked about. Seemed like a place that one might look for. He set up a makeshift camp, chewed down some jerky and tack, and grabbed himself a nice sleep.</p><p>Upon waking, Cal's mind filled with wonder and glee that he had found what he had been searching for. <i>This is it! But why was I searching for this place?</i> Cal searched the area further only to find burnt Firbolg bones and burnt equipment. <i>They did it again! They silenced us. We mustn't allow this!</i> He thought to himself. His mind turned inward upon itself. All his memories of living and growing up in a regal Firbolg village became muddled together with his recent explorations. He couldn't discern the difference and instead concluded that he must be the last of his royal line that some mysterious force seeks to end.</p><p><i>No. I cannot allow it. I must find our sacred land. Our true Kingdom. The only way is to connect with those who claim royal positions here in this region and beyond. I must rebuild our people.</i> Crazy Cal made his was through the tangled forests to the nearest town and began his meager political campaign to recharge his royal line. Although he is not consciously aware of his Firbolg clan's monastic heritage, his muscle memory and reflexive training are embedded within him. A contradiction, this Firbolg monk is loud and brazen.</p>

      <p>The Ter family have been free of the Underdark for generations. Having integrated themselves well within the community of the Town/City of Allaris [Any minor or major Town or City with decent traffic], they have found an abundant life as traders, innkeepers, barkeeps, and the like. Giza remains close with her family and, because of their adaptation of dislocation into comfortable living, she promotes the values of hearth and home as a mindset, rather than a bloodline or geographical location.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The Goliaths of Gond'Qor are known as devout followers of Re, the God of Hooves and Horns [Any Central Goliath Deity]. These religious peoples promote strength and fortitude in their followers and advocate for supporting the strengths and good in others. Raised in this complex ritualistic community, Irtano developed a strong set of powers, abilities, and skills, and an even stronger set of ethics about how to treat himself and others. This also imbued him with high expectations as to how others ought to treat him.</p><p>The Order of Re have set missionary goals whereby they send accomplished acolytes out into the Realms to aid in building up the 'lesser-thans' and promote their code of interconnected support. Irtano was selected as one such acolyte and sent forth to display his strength and abilities and to promote the Order's code of a Realm-wide brotherhood of strength and support.</p>

      <p>The Halflings of Yeilumph [Any Small Halfling Town] are known for their high quality of life and especially their indulgences. This community loves to develop the finest of all things pleasurable, from candies to sexual events, from the most exotic crossbred fruit to the jams made from those fruit to use as fillings in a wondrous danish. The population of Yeilumph hold the belief that these indulgences are the answer to life's troubles.</p><p>Enter Cruda. A young halfing woman who loved a good slice of Sylvan Nut Bread with Apple butter for breakfast every morning, followed by a tart Flumberry Danish and a good swig of Pine Brew Cider to wash it all down. Her love for pastries and breads meant that she spent most of her time at the local bakery interacting with the baker and all of her staff. Slowly but surely, Gruda learned the trade. Along the way she also uncovered new methods of growing grains to produce different colors and textures. The innovation was so spectacular for the shop and the trade in general that the people nicknamed her, "Wheatsheaf".</p><p>Gruda longed to spread the joy of baked goods to the rest of the realm. She took the coin she earned for her innovation and purchased a small home in the nearby city of PinionMast [Any major trade City]. She gleefully carted her supplies and goods to the markets of PinionMast. Upon arriving in town to offer her fine baked goods it seemed there was little to no competition. Gruda had a corner on the tastiest baked goods around. She longs to open her very own shop one day.</p>

    introduction: Khedoldosh maintains a tent/hut at the outskirts of a market or tavern district with a sign above the entrance that glows with faint magical energy and reads, "TELLINGS".

    background-story: |
      <p>In the battle of Granite Water [any great historical battle in recent time], an old orcish warlock, Gryt Tooth of Mahl, was faced with certain death at the hands of an incoming legion of the Elves of ThistleCloud [Any Major Elven City]. He turned to his last resort: an old summoning scroll that was tattered. In desperation facing the encroaching legion, the warlock uttered as many words as he could read from the scroll and performed whatever gestures he could make out to cast the spell. Flashes of light and shadow burst from nowhere, colliding in mid air in a cloud of grainy black mist that congealed into the form of a beholder. However, the scroll had been damaged badly and the verbal and somatic components thus distorted. The unfortunate result was an undeveloped creature, Khedoldosh, who glanced around with its only working eye, realized the imminent danger, and darted off into the hills. Needless to say, Gryt Tooth didn't live much longer.</p>

      <p>After years in the city of Hula-krah [Any sky city in the Plane of Air] as a Peacekeeper and high-ranking military official, overlooking the material planes in all their woes, Aeureek decided it was the duty of her people to bring justice to the ground. She conferred with officals and family about her decision and they were all in agreeance; it was time for the people of the sky to bring the freedom of true justice to the greedy land-dwellers. Aeureek and numerous other worthy and authorized members of the community were sent on their way to aid the ground-dwellers.</p><p>Aeureek settled into the crime-ridden town of Helmsloft [Any major city that could suffer from heavy crime] and confidently approached the town's magistrates. She provided a convincing speech as to how the city required changes to their policing and corrections training and the corresponding structures. With her regal appearance and voice supporting a well-thought out and honest speech, which included numerous accurate observations Aeureek had gathered from his observations in the clouds, the magistrates were convinced to make such changes. Aeureek was offered a position among the magistrates but firmly declined, asserting that her abilities would best suit a position among the officers and within the confines of the slums and markets. Since then, Aeureek has been a well-respected and often feared officer and an advisor to the magistrates.</p>

    mannerisms:   Timid at first glance but courageous in spirit, Chloe will often avoid engaging with others; Order/task oriented - goes from standing still to pointing and gesturing to the next task at hand; Most often found reading through her list of ingredients for her wines and her methods of making them; Sometimes throws a wrench in the gears of watchkeeping

    background-story: |
      <p>Born and bred in the middle class market district of the city of Johseveille [Any major city], Chloe gained both a taste for and disdain for bourgeios comforts. Both of her parents were political advisors and urged Chloe into the same vocation but Chloe was rebellious in her youth, causing all kinds of trouble with local merchants and incoming adventurers. She was particularly notorious for getting so drunk on cherry or apple wine that her teeth would turn colors. One night she broke into a locel wine-maker's facility and stole a small barrel of wine and decanting equipment. Her parents quickly grew tired of this behavior and enrolled her in the local militia.</p><p>Needless to say, Chloe's dichotomous attitude continued into her years of training with the militia. She enjoyed the challenge and growth but despised the regimen and boundaries. As a coping mechanism to bring more joy to her life, Chloe turned back to wine. She's been charged with dereliction of duty on numerous occasions. However, since her parents are high-ranking political advisors she has protection against any kind of discharge from her duties. Consequently, she floats through her duties during the day and returns to her passion for wine-making at night. She has a small tent outside of her family home within which she practices methods of decanting late into the twilight hours.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>A beautiful pig can be someone's pride and joy. The smoothness and pink hues of its skin worthy of admiration from fellow livestockers. Fot learned this early in his years as his family of Hill Goblins toiled away at producing and grooming the finest pigs anyone had seen. Perhaps they worked with such fervor because they sought to clear the dirt off the name 'Goblin'. Perhaps they toiled so hard because they just loved pigs that much. Who knows? Doesn't matter to Fot. All that matters to Fot is that the pigs are healthy, smooth, and with that perfect shade of pink that makes you kiss your fingers and say, "muah".</p><p> Pigs weren't their only trophies. Fot's family also produce what they believe to be the finest Folla Tubers and Gum Beans in the region, among other vegetables. With a staunch work ethic and a kind and respectful attitude uncommon from Goblins directed towards the merchants and traders of the nearby villages and cities, Fot and his family have established a stable standard of living. But not without further hard work. Little Fot continues his daily 16 hour grind to and from trading centers and market squares as a purveyor of fine livestock and farmed goods. He is also a committed competitor in the bi-annual pig competition, "Cochonatico", and has numerous ribbons and trophies to show-off.</[>

    introduction: Often encountered while working a contracting job on a home or business, such as a tavern or inn. Performing some roofing or general repairs he may shout out to ask a party to pitch-in for some gold in return.

    background-story: |
      <p>Brushing his dreadlocks from his eyes, Albrecht stares down the elves approaching his work site. </p><p><i>"Oy, git yer dirty feet off this site! Yer gonna taint the beauty of my work!" </i>He snarls, spitting in their direction.</p><p> The two elves remark to each other about the rarity they see nailing shingles to the roof of the new tavern. A half-orc? A feral dwarf? They cannot be certain. His muscular body and scars tell a story of a man who is not civilized, per se. A man who would unleash rage upon them. The elves depart.</p><p>The progeny of a Dwarven slave woman who answered to Orcish slavers in a barbaric tribe, Albrecht had no true connection to family, as one might know it, except to hate others and unleash rage upon those who challenge him.</p><p> Tired of the poor and sloppy indulgences of his tribe, Albrecht sought greater wealth and power. He followed a trading caravan he saw passing in the distance of the plains, offering to help them with any repairs or services they might need. He continued on with this 'hired-hand' type business upon arriving in the town of Meership Downs, a small sailing port and bustling sea-side community. Here he grew his talents, but also his hatred for other races as the village was frequented by many types of people carousing, drinking, fighting, and all-around ne'er-do-wells. Now, Albrecht focuses on having his 'stamp' on as many buildings, ships, wagons, and so forth, as he possibly can. He puts his anger and hatred into his work knowing that unleashing his rage would not only be dangerous for others, but most certainly for himself.</p>

      <p>In a moody drawl, Teaghan lists off the provisions ordered by the head of the local militia. Their defense of Synon-Dor [Any major city] requires that each and every militia member is well-fed and Teaghan is aware of this and her important role in the defense of the city. She is, after all, the primary provisioner for the militia.</p><p>Raised in the farmlands surrounding the city that were provisioned by Baron Korimir Havensloch upon the inception of his oligarchical rule, Teaghan spent her early years as a farmhand on the farmlands of her immediate and extended family. /p><p>When the threat of encroaching waves of Hobgoblins and Orcs threatened the security of the city, the militia required more streamlined channels for sundries and provisions. The Baron chose the Forestlight family as the primary provisioner and Teaghan's family were locked into the role.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Always the ham of his large family, Eldaren had an innate talent to entertain others, whether that be through song, dance, or comedy. It simply came natural. His family were very supportive of this talent and young Eldaren quickly became a popular feature in his village performing in full-on stage productions, strumming a lute in the local tavern, or all-dressed-up in his famously ridiculous clowning garb and performing long mime sequences in the village square.</p><p>His name eventually became known among other connected towns and cities. Eldaren's talents were requested by playwrights and tavern keepers throughout the region. He soon became a recognizable celebrity with passers-by remarking, "I saw your performance of Gonidorin in 'the Leaves will Fall as they May!" or something equally astounded. Only the erudite recognize that many of his performances have a hidden message promoting freeing the commoners from the clutches of the royalty.</p>

      Kraven is a crafty combatant. He will rarely take his weretiger form. When in human form he will keep distance at first, using his longbow and magic. Otherwise, he engages with his scimitars. When pressed he will retreat to a secluded area and transform to slay his opponents.

    background-story: |
      <p>Kraven is not infected. He is what one would call a 'true' weretiger born of the breed in the jungles of Khuile [Any isolated vilage of Weretigers]. Set upon a collection of river mouths draining into the sea, he and his brood were also skilled sea-men. His clan claim to be descendents of the original weretigers and remain staunchly noble in their dealings with others with the hopes of changing public opinion towards lycanthropes.</p><p>Kraven set forth on such an information campaign but was met with rebukes and violence. His lycanthropic form was incredibly dangerous in defence of many violent altercations, many of which unfortunately resulted in murders.</p><p>Kraven thus turned his hand to what was in his heart: sailing, artwork, shadows, magic, mystery, and music. Combining these passions, Kraven is one of the first and only tattoo artists in the region who can offer magic tattoos - at a costly price.</p>

    introduction: This sketchy old elf is something of a myth more than a man. He remains well out of sight of guards and militia yet regularly has secret dealings with the middle to upper eschelons of local political factions. If adventurers passing through town appear to have valuable items or be capable of acquiring such items, he will contact them through secret letters via an innkeeper or bartender and arrange a meeting in a private place. He may also commission a particularly remarkable group to find certain valuable items.

      The "Pennymore Con" is in search of a magic stone with sigils carved into it. It passed through his fencing shop and in the process captured an aspect of his soul. He doesn't know what it does but he knows it will bring him riches at the expense of others so he never says anything, but instead dreams of it night and day.

    background-story: |
      <p>As is well known across the Realms, Elves live a very long time. During these extensive life-spans, they are susceptible to major life changes, whether in vocation, direction, location, or what-have-you. Nobody knows where the Con hails from, they only know that he is a Sylvan Elf because of his gaunt, lanky, and gruff appearance, ruddy skin and hair, and his bright silverish eyes. Nobody is sure what life trajectory brought the Pennymore Con to where he is today. The few things that are known about him could be myth.</p><p>The Con is blamed across the Realm for various high-level robberies and for starting various skirmishes between nations by offering a contract on an important local Duke in exchange for a long-sought after item that had been fenced to him. Constantly seeking business with members of every eschelon of a city or town, the Con is open about his business dealings but opaque as to his motivations. Consequently, although suspected of high crimes, none have been proven and the Con is allowed free movement. In fact, his movement is likely advocated among higher magistrates because of the goods and services they've obtained from him through less-than-legal means.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Glotys had a simple and genuine upbringing by a Dwarven family in love with the wilderness. They lived in a small village on the outskirts of the great hill Dwarf Empire of Ualen [any major Dwarven Empire] renown for their generosity in supplying the rest of the realm with forged goods, gems, and precious ores. Her peoples' passion for what wealth and goods lay within the hills did not appeal to her. Instead, Glotys took a liking to the nature above ground. The blooming of flowers and how their pollenation by bees rejeuvenated the life that flourished above ground.</p><p>Her passion for bees was so profound that as she learned more and more about the ecology of her surroundings the busy little insects were drawn to her. Her hard work and staunch dedication to learning more of her surroundings were rewarded with certain magicks that enable her to communicate with the tiny pollenators and call on them for help. These moments inspired her to begin an endeavour to provide housing and even greater love and support to these important components of the ecosystem.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>A largely forgotten child of a wealthy Dragonborn family nearly obliterated by discriminating Elven and Human armies, Captain Wheeler became something of a man-whore chasing females for personal validation. In these seedy social circles, he connected with the Violet Conch, a high-sea slaver group who traded in peoples of any race or social class so long as it was profitable. Realizing his opportunity at wealth (and not caring that others would suffer) Captain Wheeler trained with the Violet Conch, learning the 'ropes' of sailing and trading peoples as goods. The process largely wore down his moral compass.</p><p>Regardless of these heavy experiences, Wheeler (renamed by his sailmates - his original name only known to him at this point) is well known as the 'beast who inspires' or the 'spirit of the wandering sailor' because of his profound fecundity with respect to sea-shanties. Those shanties have become even more renown because of their magical effects - often saving sailors and their ships in crisis.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Whispering to an Amyrillis that <i>"the current war will end soon",</i> a young Moss heard a quiet voice in her head.</p><p>You have the gift, child.</p><p>Moss was suddenly struck with a channel of supernatural energy from beyond. Her mind was filled with visions of nature while her body was struck with unfortunate disabilities. At this point, when the Goddess of Blooms, without location but existing within every seed and petal, touched her, Moss became aware that she was destined for more than a life arranging flowers for others.</p><p>Moss' real name is lost in time. Raised in a testosterone fueled environment with 3 brothers and a long-passed mother, Moss was beleaguered with pseudo-abuse directed towards her womanhood. She absorbed these in her youth, thinking it was normal, but after touched buy the Goddess of Blooms she realized the horrors of which men are capable. In this moment another insight was whispered directly into the center of her mind.</p><p><i>Men are but the seeds. Save the soils, milady. Bless the petals. Love the stems. Revere the roots. But we will always be able to produce more seeds.</i></p>

      <p>Nobody can be sure how Scheuschzeri ended up in the ponds. But everyone kows that he hears the best of the news because he's always treading water in a well-placed pond. Scheuschzeri will spend most of his time in deeper waters by the wharf in the sea-side frontier village of Griptight Keep [Any Seaside Trading Village] overlorded by the pirate baron Koon The Bold. He spends daytime hours skipping out of the wharf into the various marshy puddles that characterize the paths of the village overhearing conversations. He's become so attuned to these interactions and the value of their content to others that he often positions himself in the best spots to overhear the best possible informations.</p><p>How did poor Scheuschzeri become this this way? Nobody is completely certain. Some claim that he was once a pirate who had fallen in love with a Siren while at sea and upon his attempt to capture her heart she laughed in his face and banished him to the ponds and wharf-side. Others tell a story of how it was his own choice; that he is actually a powerful sorcerer who grew tired of his capabilities and cast this polymorph on himself in reverence of the greater society.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Princess Ateh may or may not be a princess anymore. Her peoples' kingdom of Jujubalanah [A halfling kingdom that has been lost (or maybe not!)] did not fair well in the Goblin and Hobgoblin raids of the Dark Reckoning of Rakosh Ghaal [Any Goblinoid or Orcish Deity]. Largely razed to the ground, Jujubalanah was once a bright kingdom populated by loving and generous halfings and their ilk. Ateh was among their best. Having been driven from her kingdom by war and subsequently hunted by the viscious dark forces of Rokash Ghaal, Ateh now remains in hiding yet continuesher well-skilled political performances for various factions within the realms to promote equality and abundance.</p><p>Her peoples believed in the beauty imparted by by Ku, her peoples concept of a central spiritual entity. The philosophy of Ku dictates that all things happen at the same time and that time is merely the gift of enjoying every moment that has or will exist. Her beliefs fuel her beauty and her beauty fuels her beliefs.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>When someone needs something dirty done, something that will inspire ire in the minds of the local guard or militia, one does not turn to a friend or even an acquaintance unless they wish trouble to descend upon their home or business. Instead, one turns to a paid person, a person who they may only know through stories at the tavern or from the songs of a bard. Samuel Cohen comes up in both story and song. His dreams ring of each story and lyric. A haunting or a gift? Not even Samuel can tell.</p><p>Samuel is an orphan. He hasn't received word from the clergy as to who his parents were or the circumstances through which he was dropped off. One thing he does know is that he doesn't really care. Family is for the blind. His youth in the orphanage in a small town was as expected: violent and traumatizing. He learned quickly the value of exchanging things or coins for safety or services. What's more, and what he may not have even consciously learned, per se, was from the conditioning imposed upon him by the clergy of Khalal [A separatist sect turned sour], a deity of scarcity largely followed by the marginalized and desperate. These priestesses and nuns would subject the children to questionable behavior modification experiments in their sleep. There goal was to remove the resentment and contempt from the desperate and replace it with gratitude and hope. Little did they know, they had created entire worlds in the minds of their guinea pigs.</p><p>Upon release from the clergy during his adolescence, Samual vowed to care about only one thing: how he could advance himself in the waking world.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The Drow are a largely rejected race in the Realms. Numeorus tribes have departed from traditional ways in hopes of achieving peace for themselves and between themselves and the denizens of the Upper World. The clans of Dire Dawa [Any Underdark Village] of North Woreda [Any Underdark Region] seek such noble ends. A self-appointed council of diplomats in this village have made it their goal to spread the word that the people of the Underdark are best set to survive and flourish with the cooperation of the other races of the Realms. </p><p>Since most magic is under strict control within most of the Underdark and thus messages and missives are difficult to convey, the peoples of Dire Dawa needed to rely on actual footwork to pass messages between and across the peoples of the Underdark who sought to escape the control of the few dark deities who had gained the majority of control in the regions. They relied on 'runners' to bring messages back and forth. Abrinet was chosen as one of the few to play this revered position.</p><p>Although not the fittest or most able, it was her commitment to absolving the Underdark of its ills that convinced her town council to appoint her as a 'runner'. She has yet to let them down, except for her more than occasional travels to the Upperworld.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>There really aren't any swamp Gnomes. Except for Yasloh. Emerging from a mountain cave on a dimly glimmering morning, the Gnome sputtered at the sun, "Yes, yes, I know that already", and coughed up a bit of flem in his hand. He slapped his hands together and rubbed them vigorously, laughing to himself. "What does this day have to offer?" He stepped forward out of the cave and his foot found no ground. The black swamps of Kol-oug had deceived yet another. Whoever Yasloh used to be was absorbed into the gritty sandy mire of Kol-oug. How could I have forgotten the bloody swamp? Was the last thought that crossed his mind before the Mind Flayer pit swamp consumed his identity.</p><p>Three days later a small humanoid limped his way towards a makeshift Halfling military camp. "Who goes there?", cried the lieutenant. The "Brain" began to reflect upon itself and found nothing. Well, who does go here? He asked himself. Nothing. "Who goes there?" The lieutenant asked again. Oh, well, I had better answer him. He seems important. "Brain!" Yasloh shouted the only thing he could think. "Brain" approached the militia party having all the smarts he had before but having no idea who he actually was. "Oy, innit a gnome...", the halfling lieutenant remarked, "covered in muck". "Yes", Yasloh replied, "a swamp gnome". "But there's no such..." Yasloh shot the soldier an intimidating glance. Silence. They gave "Brain" a place to clean up and change. </p><p>During this reflection time his mind filled with criss-crossing images of shimmering grids and incoherent numbers and languages. These hallucinations eventually began to congeal into gears, sigils, machinations, glyphs, and locations of great power. It appeared as though Yasloh had fallen asleep in the bath at the camp and he began muttering incomprehensibly in an increasing volume until he was nearly shouting. A young Halfling soldier approached to shake him awake. "Sir. Sir? Are you okay? Are you..." And Yasloh shot up in the bathtub screaming valorously, "I've got it mate!" He may have lost his past but now saw the many magical inventions that would define his future.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Needless to say, Orcs aren't known for their navy. Yet that isn't to say that Orcs aren't sea-men. Born and raised by the Yellow Teeth tribe in the Northern Wastes of Kalauzumar [Any Remote Wasteland], Nagata was taught in swamp navigation and eventually in how to navigate the more shallow seas that surrounded the Wastelands. An ambitious young man, he dreamed of a life on the seas. But he knew this wouldn't be possible within the confines of his tribe. Although he tried his hands at engineering various war machines for his tribe and was actually quite talented at it, this couldn't possibly compare to his dreams of living a life on the high-seas. </p><p>Although he loved his people, he loved the sea more. After yet another unecessarily violent raid by his tribe on a sea-side frontier town they made there way back towards the black swamps they deemed their home. Nagata was dismayed. He took a quick look around at the crew, made a broad and clearly unsuspicious gesture towards the starboard bow of the ship and whistled clearly (a known call for his shipmates) and then made a deliberate and unnoticeable dash to the port side of the ship diving off quietly into the water.</p><p>Nagata swam to shore unnoticed and sat on his knees. He ran his fingers through the sand, muttering, "dear sea, you have me".</p>

      <p> The royals of Avonguard Vale [a Forest Gnome City] have difficulty tracing their lineage because of infidelity of the High Tinker Yahnigan Buuhl. His lecherous infidelity has diffused his line many, many times. Among this brood, one stands apart because of her combination of madness and beauty - Fuchsia.</p><p>She is well aware of her royal lineage but has been denounced from announcing it. Yet she couldn't care less and often flaunts it in the presence of just about anyone who will listen, claiming that her mother, a barmaid named Clarice, is the Low Queen of the Region. She weaves stories about her life as the Low Queen's daughter at local taverns and mercantile houses, gaining quite an audience who are more than happy to pay for her discursive talent.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The town of Hovering Heights [any small settlement], located in the rim of the Pallisade Mountains [Any small to medium Mountain Range] isn't renown for much besides some breads and fruit farming. The peoples of Hovering Heights all long for some kind of excitement and Dharja is no exception.</p><p>Raised in a very humble household of goblinoids repressed into commoners, Dharja learned the skills of his parents, who were general caretakers contracted by local merchants and innkeepers. He longed for adventure and to unleash what he believed to be a vast creative potential within him, but has never had the chance. Instead, he's largely resigned himself to shuffling about with a mop through Lady Sybil's hospital for the infirm.</p>

      <p>The art of storytelling is lost on some. Lovecarp however does not belong to that poor group. Renown throughout the realms for his talents at weaving together fables of grand design, his name is forever tied to tales begun in taverns that travel mouth to mouth across vast distances.</p><p>Some have heard that Lovecarp is the lineage of royalty while others have spun tales of their own about his humble beginnings. His regal garb dirtied from travels confuses people. This is perhaps his goal. Nobody but Lovecarp himself truly knows. Traveling town to town crafting new stories and refining old, he gleefully shares his narrations with every listener with very little resistance. At the first hint of his gripping voice, most of those in the vicinity grab a tankard and sit down for one of the best stories they will hear for miles and miles.</p><p>Well aware that racial tensions not only fuel wars but also economic splendour, Lovecarp's stories almost exclusively revolve around if not at the very least include complex layers of peoples' fears of those who are not like them - the 'Other'.</p>

    background-story: |
      Reina was cursed as a young child, possibly for something her outlander parents did. She was given the Curse of the Forgotten which allows only characters with high perception (16) to even see her and only characters with exceptional perception (19+) to remember she exists if they aren’t directly looking at her. This has left Reina to raise and fend for herself from a young age. She longs for friends and connection while doing what she needs to to survive. She longs to return to the barbarian clan that forgot her as a child but lives on city streets as a pick pocket and thief. What Reina doesn’t know about herself is a very dangerous secret for everyone.... Reina is The Wraith! Her curse is actually a spell put on her a spymaster of the assassins guild at the same time that he murdered her tribe and created her split personality. When her skills are needed a simple subliminal phrase brings out the Wraith, the realms deadliest assassin, and Reina never remembers a thing.

A prof. took him in as an assistant and fed Yemik's curiosities. Yemik has a desire to give the world the gift of knowledge, hoping to make a book that would be in every household.

    background-story: |
      He grew up in a Triton city and lived there until his early teens, when he accompanied a team to dry land for the first time. There he saw a firestorm and while the other Tritons avoided it, he felt irresistibly drawn to it and has loved fire since. However, he once accidentally burned a valuable book while playing with the fire and is constantly looking for ways to feed his pyromaniac self while not burning any books and avoiding the natural uncomfortable feeling that most Tritons have around fire.

      <p>The 2nd born son of a local baron, Draake could never stay still. As a young boy, he was formally trained as a knight. He and his brother Trassel were inseperable, but Draake knew he would never rule and he hated the pomp of court life. At 16 he left the castle in the night looking for adventure. He found it in a tavern where he met Taron. The two teenagers quickly became friends.</p><p> Leaving his hometown of Oxlight behind him, the two adventured far and wide, both starting and ending many fights along the way. During this time, the charismatic Draake convinced more adventurers to join their ranks. At 24, Draake was captured on a raid and brought back to town. His brother, now Lord, almost didn't recognize him.</p><p> Granted clemency, the two agreed to enrich each other. Trassel ensured that Draake would become the local bandit leader by sending his soldiers against all other gangs and in return Trassel recieved a cut from every raid. Draake would keep the gang in line and would take new recruits (criminals from Oxlight) which helped lower expenses for Trassel and made him look better to the king. This arrangement has persisted for the last 26 years.</p>

      Once a shining beacon of light and justice, Nothuriel stuck a deal with dark gods to bring her betrayed love back from the dead. Her lover was returned to her as a lich, driving her mad and causing her to embrace the darkness and do the bidding of the dark gods forever. Now she leads legions of the damned and undead against the light.

    background-story: |
      Karin is a lieutenant in the Bakerfield Family thieves guild. He is responsible for the neighbourhoods on the north, central part of the city and he gleefully squeezes every last copper piece out of the people that live there.
      |
      He is not the smartest of Varun's Lieutenants, but he is the most sadistic. Causing pain and suffering is not merely a means to an end with Karin, it is a source of pleasure. Missing a protection payment will have merchants on the wrong end of a savage beating at the hands of this smiling giant.
      |
      Karin grew up in a modest middle class family until they were murdered in cold blood when he was 10 years old. His mother was an only child and her parents died when Karin was still very young. His father was estranged from his family and refused to take Karin in. He found himself living on the streets begging for food until a Bakerfield family crew took him on as a petty thief.
      |
      As he grew up, his muscles grew out. As did his temper and his taste for blood and tears.
      |
      Aside from running his district, when Varun Bakerfield needs someone to deliver a particularly brutal beating or physical intimidation, Karin is likely to get the call.

    background-story: |
      <p>Thaerus is a water Genasi and, like most Genasi, she sometimes struggles to fit in to a society where she rarely sees another living being that looks like her. Unlike most Genasi, she was not abandoned by her Djinn parent (in her case, her father Cryxistmalin). Instead, she was abandoned by her half-elf mother on the steps of a monastery several days travel from the home where she was born.</p><p>Growing up in the monastery, Thaerus excelled in her monastic training and grew ever more proficient in the art of fighting with her preferred weapon, the spear. Cryxistmalin would occasionally visit Thaerus secretly as a child and tell her stories of a long lost village by the sea that was settled by the Genasi children of a handful of water Djinn who somehow found each other in the world. </p><p>Thaerus believed this story to be entirely fiction through her childhood and adolescent years, and would likely still believe so today if she hadn't witnessed her father's murder; a punishment for revealing this secret to her administered by another, more powerful Djinn. Cryxistmalin used his last dying breaths to hide Thaerus from the eyes of Djinns who would see to have this secret die along with imbuing her weapons with elemental magic and providing her with a large sum of wealth.</p><p>Today, Thaerus is obsessed with finding this lost city, learning why it's existence is such a strongly protected secret and avenging her father. She has invested her inheritance from her father in the development of an archeological exploration company that she uses to track down this settlement and unearth other secrets of the realm's past along the way.</p>

      They, like the others of their kind, were born whole-cloth from the Aether. They were trained as a thief and assassin for the previous crime lord and did his bidding until the day They were supposed to die. But Gothenni didn't want to die. Their will to live proved stronger than the nature of Their being and in Their final moment They absorbed the total life essence of their employer, extending Their life and ending his. From that point on, They took over as the new boss and continued to feed their Vampiric Hunger with anyone who crossed Them

      Varun can't resist antagonizing families linked to high culture. He brings attention to himself by flaunting his wealth.

      Varun is one of very few who know that the Bakerfield family is now run by a Lich who lives across the continent using the family's resources to further his quest to become a god. Varun also knows where all of the bodies are buried (metaphorically because he has his finger on the pulse of the city, and literally because he put a lot of the bodies there.)

    - Varun's great club
    - "Widowmaker" is never far from his grasp. It was imbued with a strong magic that makes it easier and faster to wield by the Lich whom he secretly serves. Mechanically
    - it is a +3 magic weapon. Varun has had this club since he was a teenager
    - living on the streets of Underboot [or any slum in the major city who's criminal underworld he now runs]. He could barely wield it then

    background-story: |
      <p>Varun Bakerfield developed his dog-eat-dog attitude growing up on the streets of Underboot [or another slum in a major city] in the shadows of the cosmopolitan city of Invasaad [or another major, advanced city.] To this day, he despises those born with a silver spoon in their mouths and the culture that they enjoy. </p><p>Supremely confident, he believes that what he lacks in book learning, he more than makes up for in raw intellect and street-smarts. Furthermore, he knows that if he can’t win an argument with words, he can settle one with his fists, or his club “Widowmaker” just as easily.</p>
      |
      As a natural leader, people have always naturally been drawn to him. It is this natural charisma combined with utter ruthlessness that allowed Varun to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld until he was ready to start his own thieves guild, the Bakerfield Family. From there, he waged a war on the other guilds, winning turf wars with violence and cunning until he and his guild were the only street level gang standing.
      |
      During his rise, to help assure victory, Varun made a deal with a Lich named Ryxiltan. In exchange for a large portion of his guild’s earnings, Ryxiltan used his magic to permanently increase Varun’s strength and leadership presence going as far as giving him the ability to bend weak-minded criminals to his will whenever he pleased.
      |
      Being the servant of a powerful Lich is no easy task. Despite his success, Varun regrets the deal he made and is looking for ways to get himself out of it.

      Driven out of his clan when he was challenged by a younger, stronger Bugbear for the role of pack alpha, he went into exile rather than die fighting for leadership. He wandered for several years fending for himself before he was captured by slavers and sold into servitude as an enforcer/security. He found that he relished his new role as it provided a steady meal, a frequent outlet for his aggression and as little thinking as possible

      In her youth she was like the rest of her crop, she spent all of her time training for The Trials. One day while training in the Library of Kefnet, somebody left out an old ancient tome for her to discover that revealed pieces of the true history of Amonkhet.  Since then she has devoted her life to researching and uncovering the real history of her world while hiding her search from her superiors

      His family has a long history of military service and trained his whole life to follow in his ancestors footsteps. He joined up the day he turned of age and has never looked back. Advancing through the ranks quickly and his devotion and natural charisma made him a prime candidate for recruiting officer.  Baruvo loves his job

      There are some downsides to having amnesia. When Noel finds out about their past, if events go against their current alignment, Noel would make a wisdom saving throw (DC 10). If they fail, they take 1d4 physic damage and that damage is removed from their max HP.

      Noel starts as a Ranger. When the DM reveals more information about Noel's past through the story, Noel is able to reflect those changes on their character sheet: Meaning that if in Noel's past, the DM reveals they were a thief, Noel could obtain proficiency in thief's tools, or even multiclass as a rogue. This special ability can happen at anytime and is not related to experience, but is up to the DM.

    background-story: |
      Noel was not always a warforged. They remember the grass upon their feet and the taste of mead, but nothing else, not even their name. The name Noel comes from an old manufacturing plate located on the body they woke up in: Number 31 (No.31). The body was long ago discarded. Noel awoke in a mass grave of warforged with only a name in their head. The are not sure if the name is theirs or if it is someone they once knew. They have been searching for answers to no prevail. They have been kicked out of towns and shunned from inns for the way they look. They have only ever found sanctuary in temples and alone in the woods.  They have resorted to requesting local clerics to ask around about the faceless name for any answers. 
      |
      The true backstory of this character is up to the DM. Is this character somehow connected to your party or the BBEG? 
      |
      were they in a romantic partnership with a necromancer or Lich and when they died, their partner did everything they could to bring them back? 
      Were they a warlock that made a deal with their patron? After they died did the patron put their soul into a machine for them to continue to serve? Are those memories actually their own, or are they being manipulated? 
      |
      There are so many possibilities, that I wouldn't feel right cementing only one background for this character. Adjust as needed for your own campaign.

      They grew up as an exile as most of their race do. They tend to be met with distrust and persecution even by those of their own kind. Gex has has always had a call to being a performer, but when in their late teens they were found out to be a changeling, they were run out of town by the very audience they craved. At that point, they were approached and taken in by a spy master and trained in the ways of information gathering and when it comes to that calling, there is no one better

    background-story: |
      <p>Ahshani came from a small but noble house from a distant continent [any with PanAsian historical flare].  He trained from a young age in the way of the samurai and according to his master was destined to be the greatest of his time. As a teen, he fell in love with a local serving girl, much below his station. Forbidden by his house to see her, he continued to sneak out to spend time with her.</p><p>One night while he was clandestinely in his lovers arms, his master was assassinated and his house was murdered. Blaming himself, Ahshani gathered his armor and his master's blade and left his home, becoming a ronin. Swearing to fight against evil wherever he finds it, all the while searching for the answers to who murdered his family their motivations for doing so.</p>

      Hadoovra is a mountain dwarf that has left the mountains and moved to the city. After fighting her way through architectural and engineering school, she works hard every day to prove herself in a male dominated industry. Her fierce drive to master her craft and get ahead has made her well know and respected in her vocation, but she is also well known for letting her temper get the better of her. Her strong work ethic has also lead to a bit of a drinking problem in he relaxation time, which also does not help her temper at all

    background-story: |
      Raise as a druid by his people and initiated into the Golgari Guild at a young age for training, he has an extensive knowledge of the routes and pathways through Ravnic's UnderCity. The UnderCity is a dangerous place filled with rot, decay and other not so nice things.  He was injured during his ascension trial to become a full Golgari Spore Priest, accounting for his limp, and still holds a grudge against the elf who caused the injury. One day he'll get his payback. In the meantime, He takes pride, probably too much pride, in getting the Golgari High Council's guests safely through the UnderCity unscathed.

    background-story: |
      <p>A war erupted in the recent past in the Fhinnenqaal Range [expansive mountain range] between Mountain Dwarves and Drow battling for control over the myriad passages and veins of ore contained in the region. This war disturbed more than the populations of Mountain Dwarves and Drow. Ongoing skirmishes spilled over into Tiefling villages nestled within the cave entrances to the Fhinnengal Range.</p><p>Neither population were aware that these Tieflings praised Kenaan [or another Tiefling God of Destruction], whose nihilistic followers only became more fervent in their belief that the destruction of the Realm is the only cure for the madness infecting the other races and peoples.Ysyfar was born and raised in this culture and inculcated with their deep religious beliefs and rituals that centered on eradicating not just the peoples of the realm, but the realm itself. </p><p>He gained popularity among his people for his religious services that provided vicious and scathing diatribes condemning the other races. As the war spilled over into surrounding villages, Ysyfar proudly organized forces to defend his people. This religious paramilitary group gradually grew into an offensive force and Ysyfar was granted leadership as Martial of Kenaan. </p><p>With an entourage of soldiers of his order, this devoutly faithful warrior travels the region visiting temples of various deities to evaluate their role in the wars that characterize the races. He is very calculated in these 'visits', aware that he and his Order, while not well known, are not accepted nor desired among the other communities of the region. Often found in deep prayer at the entrance to a temple or to a statuette of a deity acceptable to Kenaan, Ysyfar will rarely compromise his maleficent pilgrimage and instead do everything possible to keep himself and his entourage appearing as peaceful pilgrims from a respectable Order.</p>

    background-story: |
      The TwoHills clan has been the local Firbog tribe's caretakers of the dead for centuries and Dorcan is no different. He genuinely cares for the dead and their families. He loves the quiet and peacefulness of his inherited profession. He is a devout follower of the nature god Lallanis and draws his powers from her. His garden and chapel is lush and well kept, with all manner of flora and fungi. He is always welcoming, although he always keeps a close eye on non-Firbolgs when they're around. The garland of flowers that he wears around his neck at all times is the holy symbol that he uses as his spellcasting focus.

    background-story: |
      The child of an errant Water Djinn and a Sea Elf, Uthriel has sea water in her veins. She grew up in and around the ocean and is more comfortable at sea than on land. In her teens she left her seaside home to attend a Sorcerer's University in the capital. Being that far from the water didn't sit well with her for long, so after just 2 years she returned and began working on ships until she had made enough money to buy her own. The Djinn Rummy is her ship and she runs cargo for customers but her favorite jobs are delivering adventurers to exotic locales.

The combination of his martial and psi abilities make him an unstoppable killing machine, unless he loses interest in the fight. He is also a rebel among his people. </p><p>After living hundreds of years in the Astral Plane, he grew tired of the rigid militaristic ways of his people and escaped to the material plane to find new sources of entertainment.</p><p>Arrogant, aggressive and cruel, his favorite source of entertainment is battle and torture. He may briefly align himself with a party if he thinks their goals might be fun and keep him entertained for a while, but it's unlikely he'll remain on their side for long if there's not enough battle to keep his interest.  At which point, he'll probably just kill them and continue on his journey</p>

      Kraark was raised and still lives with a clan of goblins that has worked for the city's Thieve's Guild for generations. The guild has done well by his clan and they have been good steady earners for the guild. Small and quick, he can easily get in and out of places unnoticed that others have trouble with so occasionally he gets called on for bigger robbery jobs, but most of the time hes just a street thief.

    #
    background-story: |
      Raskolnik was born to a low-ranking court bureaucrat father, who was intelligent to the point of unfulfilled dreams, and a moderately wealthy mother, whose inheritance was spent before her children knew the words "dice", "wine" or "whores".
      |
      
      Raskolnik's father was inadvertently trampled by a mail coach when Raskolnik was a young child. His mother, now without income and living in poverty in a grand manse among the snow elves, had little choice but to sell the remnants of her inheritance and take up residence in the squalid slums with the orcs and goblins of the north. Raskolnik's mother said, on more than one occasion, "We elves are not known for helping the downtrodden, even our own kind."
      |
      
      Raskolnik excelled at his studies, and was noticed by an orcish ambassador to the north for winning second prize in the "Essaies from the Ghetto" contest. His prose and unorthodox, even mildly disturbing, thesis had captured the imagination of the fiery, blunt orc.
      |
      
      The orcish ambassador gave Raskolnik's mother a small sum to pay for his studies in law, on the promise that she would send him to "anything but a pale-skinned school of fascist pig-donkeys." Raskolnik's mother, partly from gratitude to her son's orcish benefactor, and partly from anger at her own culture's complete detachment from her financial predicament, readily agreed.
      |
      
      Raskolnik went to a law school run by halflings. (When the orcish diplomat found out, he flew into a rage. He had envisioned a green-skinned school for green-skinned law. But that is another story that shall not be told here.)
      |
      
      His studies were spectacularly successful. The halflings considered Raskolnik one of their own. But the humans were next to adopt him.
      |
      
      During a multi-racial rhetoric competition in a prominent northern city, Raskolnik won second place overall.  The human judge took him aside after the debate and told him that he had the potential to be a great leader, a great statesman. The human asked for a written essaie that he could take to his superiors in the middle lands, and in return, the human would pave the path to a fulfilling career in the human legal system.
      |
      
      Raskolnik submitted his magnum opus to the human, sending a 20,000 word thesis on the nature of The Great Man to his would-be human benefactor. The human published it under his own name and went on a book-signing tour, only to be murdered by an orc on his yacht in the south (though that tale of greed, debauchery and violence is another story, and shall not be told here.)
      |
      
      Raskolnik, blissfully unaware of his human would-be-benefactor's fate, continued to wait, hopefully, for word from the human. He had finished law school. He sold what he owned and borrowed money from a disreputable lender. He tried valiantly to support his mother and younger sister.
      |
      
      Raskolnik's sister agreed to marry a rich, abusive man. Raskolnik became desperate.
      |
      
      Meanwhile, word had -- unbeknownst to Raskolnik himself -- gotten out that he was the actual author of the human's stolen manuscript. Raskolnik was known only by name -- not by appearance -- to be an ubermensch, a believer in Great Men who are justified in trampling the Inferior.
      |
      
      Soon, Raskolnik will discover that the local constabulary have read his treatise, and suspect him of murdering the moneylender in order to pave the way to Greatness.
      |
      
      Raskolnik is riddled with guilt, not entirely for killing the woman (he partly believes she deserved it), but also for not being Great like he should be: for not being able to carry through with his own ambitions, for not being able to Act in the way that Great Men Act.
      |
      
      Now Raskolnik is nervous, on edge, easily frightened, secretive, mysterious, defensive, yet also desperately seeking someone to whom he can confess.
      |
      
      And he still has no money to save his sister from what Raskolnik sees as a terrible, terrifying union.

    background-story: |
      <p>Krapp was born to devout kubernetic zealots in the gnomish Emerald Mines. His youth was spent weaving elaborate pods, praying to cluster, and seeking out and tagging dangerous monoliths in the Emerald Mines.</p><p>Upon his Evanescence, Krapp discovered human food, and after eating lobster, swore he would never eat "cave fish" again.</p><p>Learning to read and write human during his Evanescence, Krapp began to write plays for small traveling troupes that would pay a pittance for a weird, disconnected sequence of garbage cans and bleakness.  When his parents asked him what he actively sought in life, he said: "Nothing."  His parents misunderstood what he meant.</p><p>Krapp's seeking continued as he submitted plays to the human royal troupe for Her Majesty.  His plays were all rejected (mainly because the Queen believes in Something, Anything, Everything, but not Nothing).</p><p>Along the way, Krapp came into posession of the Ansible of Time at a cast party.  He traded a live lobster for it, and began recording his journal -- along with a newsreel of historical events -- every day for the remainder of his unsuccessful life.</p><p>Currently, Krapp is middle-aged, and his unhappiness, his mistakes, his missed opportunities, the love of his life with scratches on her legs from a gooseberry bush, are all captured in the Ansible.  So, too, are all local events.</p>In his attic apartment, Krapp has numerous rolls of cheap, hairy goatskin parchment, on which he has penned his strange, apocalyptic plays.  His attic is also littered with black, slippery banana peels, and fruit flies are his flatmates, even in winter.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Swarth was born large to large parents. His mother's breasts would have firehosed a more delicate babe, and his father's flatulence alone could knock out a vast forest filled with yellow canaries. Both parents were chefs, and both died of diabetes when Swarth was in his teens.<p><p>By then he had acquired talents for curing and preparing meats, to a level that his parents had never quite achieved. While desserts were his father's specialties, and potato dishes his mother's, Swarth prepared liver pastes and deep fried pseudodragons like no other. He worked his way up slowly, from cook to sous-chef to chef, often replacing his predecessor by virtue of fearsomeness and a frighteningly sharp cleaver.</p><p>He owns the tavern where he is now barkeep and head chef, having spent half a lifetime (and several subordinates) there.  Two pale spotty boys help out with the cooking and food preparation during busy hours, and the waitress roles are filled from a revolving door pf ladies of all ages, shapes and sizes.</p><p>Swarth's food comprises layers of various types of meat, exquisitely arranged, often with a liver paste "S" signature on top.</p><p>During a recent bar mitzvah catered by Swarth, Flee -- whether deliberately or accidentally -- slapped Swarth in the face with a chain.  Ever since, Swarth has been trying to find Flee.  He does not know what punishment lies in store for Flee, only that face is important to be saved.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Grim was born to cabbage farmers in the halfling outfront, in a community of free spirits where parentage was never quite traceable.</p><p>Raised by the whole village, her education was unfocused. She never learned the meticulously careful hoeing techniques to keep cabbage lands shoot- and weed-free; she invariably lost interest in digging irrigation channels before they were finished; and her patience for leading ox-dragons over the fields while feeding them grains and chili peppers, to fertilize the crops, was low.</p><p>Grim instead found her calling in the social gatherings of the village, and learned the fundamentals of music on lute and banjo from an elder, who died abruptly one winter in an horrific hydrogen sulfide explosion caused by overcooked cabbage leaves.  Grim's rudimentary stringed instrument skills, and her saccharine voice, soon earned her a following, both at home and, as travelers passed through town, in neighboring villages.</p><p>As her popularity grew, Grim added performance art to her shows, and began collaborating with other musicians, especially young female halflings.</p><p>Her relationship with One Skul began during a tour of the fire elf tribes of [desert], during which she also discovered hallucinogens and astral projection.  It is unclear whether One Skul himself lived with the fire elf tribes, or whether he arrived on his Ansible of Motion, or through an astral portal opened by Grim, largely because he has circulated all three rumors, and probably can't remember or distinguish reality from narrative any more in any case.</p><p>Grim alternates between performing locally in her current home town for months at a time, and touring the countryside for a few months, avoiding any town where Pyppo is performing along the way.</p><p>Grim is readily offended by people -- especially men -- giving her advice about her music or about the bardic industry.</p><p>Tales of adventure or of fantasy and wonder will knock Grim out of her catatonic brassica highs.  She enjoys a good adventure story, and her spontaneous, improvisational instinct will send her along on an adventure, too, if the opportunity presents itself.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Born to a salt miner mother and an accountant father, Stella grew up in a comfortably middle-class salt dwarf home with 4 brothers. Stella's mother instilled a solid sense of self-reliance and fearlessness toward male dwarves.  She fought hard and dirty as a child, quickly gaining reputations first as a dwarf girl not to be messed with, and later, as a bully to be feared. Along the way, though she rebelled against her father, running away from home on a number of occasions, she still acquired, through blood or through osmosis, his vigilance with money. </p><p>Emerging from the salt mines fairly young for a dwarf, Stella worked numerous positions for several years: earning her keep as baker, chimney sweep, quartermaster, governess, and personal accountant to the wild son of a lesser member of gold dwarf nobility. Stella and the wild son of the noble dwarf eloped and were married in a kubernetic horizontal pod ceremony (which is unrecognized by dwarf law, though the noble family was oblivious to this fact in their outpouring of rage).  The wild son's brothers chased Stella and the wild son from town to town for months, until they landed in a small inland port town, and the brothers lost the scent.</p><p>Stella joined the local "seamstresses" to pay for her husband's wild ways.  One day, drunk on cherry brandy, he shot her in the leg with a crossbow bolt. The local barber amputated Stella's leg.  Her clientele expanded rapidly, as word got out about "that crazy peg lady who will do anything you want" (including acts involving her peg leg).</p><p>The wild son has not been seen since the day of Stella's amputation.</p><p>Several years later, Stella opened her own house of "seamstresses" high on a hilltop surrounded by the homes of the wealthy and powerful.  As a seamstress, she has been in the pockets of most of the town's elite, including the constabulary who hound her continually for unpaid taxes. Stella's mansion on the hill is widely regarded to be the classiest brothel in town, and is of some repute even several towns down the road.  She keeps her ladies fit and gorgeous, and trains them in upper class etiquette, psychology and identifying peculiar fetishes.</p><p>Though Stella is no longer active as a "seamstress" herself, she still hears every item of upper class news, gossip, and secrets that there is to hear.  Stella knows everything about just about every wealthy and/or noble man in town.  She is always happy to gossip, though she does also know the value of a thing, and she knows when to charge, and how much to charge.</p>

      From the Harfoot subrace of Hobbits. Ordo was brought up by his parents but his parents died during a goblin raid, he was found by elves who took him in for several years and taught him their skills, he was esp good at scouting and was naturally as good as the best Elves. He showed an effortless ability with bow and knives.

      Praxius came into the world bred to be a champion, like his father and grandfather. And for a time, he was. Though age began to show its mark and he found he just couldnt adventure like he used to. 
      He wandered for a while after trying to find a new purpose, until he came across an abandoned bar within the city. He remembered his earlier days of how sometimes he just wanted to stop at a bar that didn't have constant fights or underworld presence at every turn. 
      |
      He spent the last of the gold he had repairing it and establishing contracts. Through the deals he made (and broke) he slowly learnt the tools of the trade of haggling, and now Praxxys is a thriving bar in the city. Though Praxius does lament a desire to adventure again, especially after seeing Lucia grow up into a fine businesswoman herself.

    background-story: |
      <p>The Dwarven village of Harrmuth is located in a largely isolated hilly region on the island of Er Kaal, known for its violent weather, broad chasms, and random volcanic activity. Er Kaal is also known for its wandering arcanists of multiple races, casters who enjoy toying with the fabric of reality and the genetic heritage of various populations</p>Although having a residing town council, Harmuth is under the control of the nearby Dwarven Kingdom of Ephronisia; a city renown for its rich legacy of heroicism, regality, craftsmanship, and innovation. Fatoumata's family were Harmuth's resident diplomats, placed there to keep watch over the town and help govern its people. As such, she was raised in an environment rich with political banter, charity, arts, and intellectual aspiration. This formed young Fatoumata's personality and her pursuit of all that is good and excellent.</p><p>Harmuth and other nearby villages were often the target of wandering arcanists looking to experiment with their magicks. One fateful morning while young Fatoumata wandered out to the mills to revel in their comradery and craftsmanship, a hole tore open in the ground before her and began spouting viscous black liquid like an overflowing bottle of carbonated tar. The tar gathered into a face, a gnarled old dwarf of impossibly ugly visage. It spoke to her.</p><p><i>"You. You are my daughter."</i>A growling and scraping voice boomed, <i>"and you are the opposable one. The one that will gain the leverage I need!"</i> At which point the grotesque face of tar proceeded to spout the vile bilious black liquid towards her. Both hands were doused in the black goo as she put them up to guard her face, closing her eyes tight out of instinct.</p> <p>When Fatoumata opened her eyes, the fountain of black goo was gone. But the hole remained. She looked around quickly to see if anyone, a spellcaster or demon, was responsible for this encounter, and she saw nothing but the plains between her village and lumber mills.</p><p><i>"Look to your hands, my child. My daughter,"</i> a voice rang in her head.</p><p>She looked down at her hands. Black goo was covering both but quickly evaporated once her gaze found its target. She was left with an incredible sight. A second opposable thumb on each hand.</p><p>Wondering if she'd imagined the event, she wandered back to the village to show her family. Suspiciously, her father would dodge any questions about the events and her mother would quiet her. Upon doing her own limited research, she discovered that her family has indeed had encounters with various powerful entities in the past and now wonders if one of these entities are responsible for her 'difference'.</p><p>As the years passed, Fatoumata became something of both a celebrity and a pariah. People of her town and surrounding Dwarven empire were both fascinated and terrified of her 'difference'. She has learned to adapt to this through disguise; carrying party masks with her and wearing beautiful gloves that distract from the 'difference' and draw peoples' attention to their ornate appearance instead.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Raised in the mountains, Khamal was exiled from his tribe for going into a rage and killing another Goliath during a game of Stubborn-Root. Rather than fending for himself in the mountains, he made his way down into the mainland. After witnessing a gang of orcs attacking a caravan, his sense of fairness required him to intercede and even the odds. The nobles he saved were so grateful that they invited him into their house.</p><p>His massive size, skill and rage served him well in their service and eventually he was given the job of executioner due to his strength and skill with an axe. He wears the executioner's mask as a badge of honor even though it clearly doesn't offer him any anonymity. Lately he has begun to question the rule of those in charge. His culture dictates that those with the best skills for the job should be doing the job, and its starting to become obvious to him that is not the case here.</p>

    background-story: |
      Andrel grew up in a reclusive tribe of Ghostwise and was trained early as a hunter and scout. Unlike a lot of her tribe, she was seized by the wanderlust that afflicts many Halflings, she left the deeps woods and ventured out into society to make her name. Her reputation as a hunter and guide precedes her and is widely regarded as one of the best people to help travelers find their way safely through any section of woodland.  Over the years she has also developed a strong distaste for orcs and their regular attempts to ambush travelers.

      Horatio grew up in the poor part of the city and worked his way through law school. Because of his upbringing, he's a little on the sleazy side and more concerned with making himself rich than he is actually making sure justice is done. He's good at his job, but will happily sell his clients down the river for his own benefit. He does have a little bit of internal struggle about the things he sometimes does for money and this has caused him to have a bit of a drinking problem

    background-story: |
      Growing up in a wealthy port-side community, Doomsmith heard many stories about the audacious raids of local pirates. He thus became fascinated with pirates at an early age. His parents paid for yachting lessons for him and encouraged hobby and role playing. When his parents died in a tragic carriage accident, Doomsmith cracked, stole a ship, renamed it "The Skurge" and headed out to see. He used what was left of his parents' monies to recruit a loyal crew and head off to emulate his childhood hero's.  In the time since, he has developed a reputation for ruthlessness if not necessarily efficiency. He is definitely not fond of anyone calling his bluff.

      Lasan is the son of a merchant who did the same thing he does today. Make items that work for a short period of time, sell them for more than their worth, and get out of dodge before any one is the wiser.  His dad died not too long ago, and he's still trying to cope with it. He took up adventuring for a time, but it complicated him with too many attachments, he just wasn't ready for.

      King Leon started out as a low-born soldier, however he quickly rose up the ranks with his natural talent and strength. He became known for his reputation as a powerful leader who commanded respect. After a while spent at this high position in the military, he completed a truly amazing feat of martial prowess . He became known for this deed throughout the land, and eventually word reached the king at the time, who had no heir to pass the crown to, so named Leon as his successor.

    background-story: |
      Golomir was raised in a traditional Orcish war tribe. Bored of and disenfranchised by his tribe's incessant pressure to train and their unquenchable thirst for the blood of their foes, Golomir sought deeper meaning for his life. The Shaman of his tribe, an Orog, held sacred texts that detailed rituals for contacting the population of the Feywild. Golomir gained her favor and studied these texts until he was finally able to contact the practitioners of the archfey.Golomir gained access to the fey realms and wandered there, befriending many of its denizens and adopting their medicines, attitudes, magicks, and lore. He grew his talents as a forager of medicinal herbs and a practitioner of critical care. What's more, he adopted the archfey practice of creating bobbles and dolls to represent that which he believes to be good in the world. Over time, while the Seelie taught him the ways of the wild in both the mortal and fey realms, Golomir gradually grew the curled ram horns that distinguish him from the rest of the members of the Orcish race.He now splits his time between the two realms wandering with the aim of bringing joy to those he meets. Well known for his abilities as a 'cunning man' or 'hedge wizard', a sort of shamanic voodoo medicine practitioner, he believes that joy and the greater good is only achievable through spreading health and literacy.

    background-story: |
      <p>A young Dwarven boy grew up in the mining village of Duncarve. Raised in a family of 'second-handers' - bandsmen and drags-men who would load and operate the mining carts - he was subjected to a mundane life of daily servitude. Load the cart. Steer the cart. Unload the cart. It was exhausting. He grew especially tired of watching the purveyors of the mine increase the quality of their lifestyle and of the increased riches of the merchants and oresmen who would deal in the precious materials Claideighm would cart around.</p><p><i>Bah!</i> He thought to himself. <i>This is no way to live. A slave to the gold and servile to those who deal in it.</i></p><p> The hypermasculine environment of the mines and mercantile trading classes that frequented his family shop crept under his skin. Under his skin. That's a place he would rarely visit. When he did, he knew he was out of place. And not just because of his distaste for servitude. No. It was his distaste for himself. This was not who he was really meant to be.</p><p>Claideighm decided to run away at an early age before he was further inculcated into the unescapable lifestyle and traditions of his village. He followed a merchant caravan to a nearby city and was suddenly exposed to sights and sounds, flavors and scents, skin tones and textures, that he'd never seen before. His psyche was on fire.</p><p>In a short period of time in the city Claideighm created a new narrative for himself. One that fit. He recognized that his natural figure was more attractive to the males of the races. He realized that sex and his hunger for it was a commodity under his control rather than under the control of some mercantile class.</p><p> He redeemed his soul the moment he found and purchased his first runed pants and placed his slender frame in a the shadows of the streets for passing merchants to admire. His increasing androgyny worked in his favor. They exploited them for their money at every turn and began to identify themself as neither man nor woman.They are now well-known as one of the most charming 'courtesans' in the major cities of the region.</p>

      <p>Rivan's parents were cursed by a hag while his mother was pregnant with him and he was born a Hexblood, part human, part Fey.  Because of his curse, he grew up as an outcast with his family traveling from town to town.  When he turned 16 he was approached by the hag that cursed his parents who invited him to join her to be converted to a full Fey Hag. He refused and escaped.</p><p> At that point he left his family and began finding ways to fight against his curse. Trying holy marks and sorcery, he finally stumbled across a cult of blood hunters who taught him their ways. He has been hunting Hags ever since, knowing that one day, if he doesn't destroy them all (which just isn't possible), he will become what he hates.</p>

    background-story: |
      Like most of his kind Goronk finds his identity by proving his martial prowess. Those who don't or won't fight are weak in his eyes. He doesn't trust magic users, he sees it as a crutch and believes that martial weapons are the only way to go. He's fairly easy to barter with for his services as hes more concerned with building his reputation as a fighter than he is with the money side of things. He's completely unconcerned with the moral side of his profession and will just as happily work with raiders raiding a village as he would fighting bad guys, as long as he gets to fight

      <p>Raised in a wealthy household and inheriting a substantial amount of money when his parents passed away, Weston grew up used to living the high life. Unfortunately after the passing of his father Weston Horonious Jr., a brilliant business man in the importing and exporting industry, it only took Weston III, a whole 3 years to run his family business into the ground. Couple that with his large gambling addiction and terrible gambling skill, alcohol addiction and illicit substance addiction, and it adds up to Weston III being flat broke and bordering on homeless.</p><p> He still does his utmost to keep up appearances and flits among high society parties and taverns sponging as much as he can grift despite owing a lot of people a lot pf money.</p>

But regardless, I'm absolutely positive that she's the best tailor and clothing designer I've ever seen and such a lovely beautiful person too. I can't believe she's not married yet", </i>seems to be the answer you get from anyone you ask about the gorgeous red head in the tailor shop.</p>

      <p>Rutgard grew up poor in a small mining town with not much in the way of prospects. He was a big lad and a bit of a scrapper, but had always expected to grow up and work in the mine. Unfortunately, by the time he grew up, the mine had run dry and most of the town had moved on.</p><p> Setting off to find his fortunes elsewhere with a cheap suit of leather armor and a cheap sword and bow, he quickly found work on the more unsavory side. His boss rounded up a group of like-minded, impoverished youngsters and set them loose robbing travelers and merchants along the less policed travel routes.</p><p>Proving a good fit for him, Rutgard was soon given his own crew.</p>

      <p>The Shroud is actually Maria Estivan, a formerly well known traveling actress and orphanage benefactor. Her career ended when she and her husband were attacked on the road one night. He was slain and her face was scarred.</p><p>With no husband or career to support her or the orphanage they had just built together, Maria put her acting and makeup skills to work for her and created The Carnelian Shroud and began robbing wagons and carriages on horseback. As she became more and more successful, she began to recruit groups of struggling young men and sending them out into the country side in gangs to continue raising funds so she had to venture out less and less and could spend more time focusing on her orphanage.</p><p>  As the legend grew, so did the income. Now every cent that isn't being paid to her men in the field is anonymously donated to orphanages around the countryside.</p>

    - it reveals completely different contents. Stored in an extraplanar space
    - the container may store any amount that would make sense for the size of the container
    - and then by shutting the container
    - the bag will store the contents away until the command word is spoken again.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The rise of empires has witnessed the mixing of races geographically and biologically. Hill Dwarves and Halflings have not only made peace but also engaged in mutually beneficial trade and craftsmanship. The villas of Jhandoo Marr - multiple settlements within the crags of the Eastern Fingers - are connected by various rope bridges and pulley trams. The populations of these villas combined the Halfling aptitude for creating fine clothes, textiles, and foods with Hill Dwarf expertise with gemology, metallurgy, and construction.</p><p>Not only has this alliance produced goods of wondrous value to the region but also unique individuals with a new mix of talents that the Realms have not yet seen. The mixing of minds had generated a large population of peoples with psionic abilities. Growing up in this culturally rich and diverse environment, Glem's psionics grew quickly, as did his recognition of the evolution of personal identity as an avenue for personal gain. He was able to see into peoples' minds and personal identities and quickly gather the worth of identity to each individual, to each merchant, to the Bureau, and beyond.</p><p> He thought to himself often, <i>if the Bureau of Population Control can mete out fees and fines for not having proper documents to prove who you are and what blood flows through your veins, then any of us can jump in on that process and, say, sift off a few coins here and there. With the proper expertise, of course.</i> And it wasn't long before he sought training from the local guild of Identity Traders; a faction dedicated to undermining the controls imposed by the Bureau. It was here that he perfected his skills at forgery, made connections within the community, and grew his notoriety as the 'go-to' for illegal documents required for trade, travel, and more.</p>

      <p>Training in the monastery of the Reclusive Abbots of Iremore, Firmoore's father was distant and removed. This was most  likely because Firmoore's birth was a scar on the face of the monastery since sex and procreation, especially out of wedlock, were forbidden. Thus, his existence was kept secret from the abbots and the small township of peoples that surrounded the monastery.</p><p>Although emotionally unavailable, his father still trained him in the ways of the Abbots. He learned quickly in order to impress his father and in hopes of gaining his attention. When the monastery was raided by the political faction in charge of the region and its hidden riches of lore and ornate religious items plundered, Firmoore's father was among the dead. The township was broken and its population scattered. In flight, Firmoore and his mother landed in a nearby port-town known for its fine imported ales. As his mother aged, she fell victim to a respiratory condition and Firmoore was faced with tending to her while generating a decent income.</p><p>He took to tending bar at a popular tavern and acquired a taste foe the numerous imported ales that populated its stores. He vowed to gain revenge for his father's death and would train into early hours of the morning in the storehouse of the tavern, siphoning ales as he went. He developed a drunken style that aided significantly in bouncing unruly patrons. When the owner of the tavern discovered that Firmoore had been removing him of 'surplus stock', he fired him.</p><p>Returning to his mother that evening, drunk and dismayed, he informed her of their new compromised financial position. <i>"You drunken coward,"</i> she condemned, <i>"you've let your father down."</i></p><p>Firmoore's mother passed away not long after. Left without roots, Firmoore traveled the region in search of another place to call home. Over his travels he earned significant sums fighting in pits and cages with the ardent fervor of unfulfilled revenge fueling his ferocity. Eventually finding comfort in the town of Hiraas Calling, he used the purses he collected from his brief fighting career to open the Drunken Coward, a name he uses not only for his establishment but also for himself.</p>

    background-story: |
       <p>The great battles of the Duplicity [any significant historical war] witnessed the warring of races over the sovereignty of nations. While the elves and humans were on tenuous grounds with regards to alliances and the mixing of races largely frowned upon, the increasing lack of militia led to ranked officers looking the other way when enlisting half-broods. The Sylvan elves, each tribe aligned with different unique aspects of their natural environment, drew from various natural forces. Katerina's tribe allied with Treants and their ilk. Raised by Druids of the circle of Selune [or a similar moon God/dess], her tribe stood fanatically against the forces sweeping across the wildlands.</p><p>Katerina enlisted in the army of allied humans and elves and fought valiantly in the long war. When various treaties were eventually reached and a modicum of peace blanketed the region, her people were less isolated and had folded themselves into the broader cultures of the region. Her experiences in the war sill resonated and her distaste for other races lingered.</p><p> Still heavily traumatized, her psyche remains conflicted between the traditions deeply embedded into her being and the desire to achieve her own imagined goals of establishing a Sylvan Kingdom that celebrates the trees and creations of nature. while abandoning the tinkering with technologies and dark magicks.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Primo named himself. Born Salanar Kholemdia, he had a natural knack for cooking and an imaginative way of interacting with and serving others. He seemed destined for a life in the kitchen. On a fine summer's day he strolled through the local marketplace and caught a glimpse of a local artist displaying his work. The artist was surrounded by paramours and admirers and sat leisurely in the sun.</p><p><i>Goodness. That sure beats slaving in the heat.</i> He thought to himself.</p><p>After many nights of prayer for the life of a prosperous artist to what seemed silent gods, Salanar instead turned to roaming through the small temple district of his home town. There he questioned the holy men and women why his prayers went unanswered.</p><p><i>"The God's won't respond to selfishness. Our pantheon honors the disiplined accrual of experience and provides fecund rewards for such,"</i> one notable priest replied. <p><i>"Well, who might grant me my wish?"</i> Salanar inquired.</p><p><i>"You. You can."</i> The high priest responded resolutely.</p><i>Bullshit,</i> he thought, trudging back to perform his duties in the kitchen. <i>If only I could have that life. I'd give anything.</i></p><p>That night, after a long shift stewing meats and cleaning surfaces, Salanar had a vision in his sleep of a decayed ancient elf in regal robes and ancient chain, its face sunken with black opal eyes staring straight into Salanar's bone marrow.</p><p><i>Quiet your pleas for more, boy. I'll give you all you wish for...</i></p><p>Petrified and unable to wake, Salanar sunk deeper into the dream.</p><p><i>You only need to pledge your very being to me through life and into death.</i></p><p>The figure made a broad gesture to one side and Salanar's mind was filled with an infinite number of beautiul works of art pouring over one another again and again, and again and again, and his heart filled with the hope to become the artist he always wanted. His very bones agreed to Kiaransalee's terms.</p><p>When he awoke the next morning, Salanar was filled with such confidence and inspiration that he began demanding that others call him 'Primo'. He proceeded to fill the taverns, markets, and streets with his labor and produce volumes of art.</p><p>Little did he expect, he became haunted by undeath. Ghosts, wraiths, and more, peer around corners, over window sills, and over his bed while he sleeps.</p>

<i>Wondrous item
    - instrument
    - major tier
    - uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)
2 lb.</i></p><p>
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind
    - superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist
    - each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell
    - it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw
    - thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly
    - invisibility
    - levitate
    - and protection from evil and good.

In addition
    - the Mac-Fuirmidh cittern can be used to cast barkskin
    - cure wounds
    - and fog cloud.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Hehliad was born and raised in Polsgaard, the capital city of the region and where the royal magistrates reside. As a child, her parents would bring her to the numerous festivals held on behalf of the nobility and her young mind could imagine doing nothing else with her life than perform and contribute to the kind of joy experienced there. Studying her craft throughout her younger years, she caught the attention of one of the lower magistrates who enlisted her as his assistant and a discerning eye for festival talents. It wasn't long before she was given the role of Master of the Revels and took charge to create some of the most memorable events in recent history.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>A young and adventurous Minotaur engaged in a brutal and near life-ending battle with the clerics of Hamuun [Any deity, really] in defense of his prized possession - a holy relic the Minotaur had uncovered from cave fissures. The clerics had traveled a great distance in search of the relic and most certainly were not going to forego finding it in the caves as they had performed extensive research to locate it. They did not expect a guardian minotaur.</p><p>The missionaries did not wish to slay the beast as they discovered it had been charmed to guard the relic. In the battle, the Minotaur was clubbed hard to the skull in an attempt to subdue them. The Minotaur lost  consciousness and the clerics uncovered the relic and returned it, along with the Minotaur, to their temple district.</p><p>The Minotaur came to consciousness in the presence of one of the healing priestesses of the Order - a beautiful gnomish woman.</p><p><i>"You will heal in time,"</i> she said gently. The Minotaur was overwhelmed with her beauty and overwhelmed with her gentle touch. The charm spell coupled with serious head trauma loosened the Minotaur from his memories and sense of identity. They internalized their caretaker and formed a new version of themself in their head - that of a helpful gnome.</p><p>Once fully recovered, and properly guided to an identifiable name, Roly, by their caretaker, they made their way about town looking to help others. The local innkeeper sympathized with Roly and offered them the position of Porter for the Inn. Roly's incredible service gained notoriety and local merchants and guilds began to enlist their services.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Jean-Pierre was raised in a service family. His father was a butler and his mother was a nanny. He grew up always wanting to be wealthy and looking down on the poor as well as many of what he considers "The Lesser Races" (basically any race that isn't human or elf).</p><p> As he was not wealthy despite his desperate desire to be, he went into service himself. As it turned out, he was very very good at it. He worked his way up through the restaurants around town eventually achieving the position of Maitre D at the most prestigious restaurant in the region.</p><p>He is extremely good at his job and very attentive to his highest priority guests. This serves two purposes for him; First it insures that he is tipped well and develops return customers, and secondly, it allows him to eavesdrop on his important guest, gather their secrets, and handsomely supplement his income by selling those secrets to the local thieve's guild where they can be put to good use by the underworld.</p>

      <p>Growing up in the Warrens, he was always more interested in tricks and practical jokes than he was in fighting and raiding. If goblins had class, he would have been the class clown. Because of his unwillingness to take almost anything seriously, possibly a joke gone wrong and/or on the wrong goblin, he was exiled from his clan.</p><p>After struggling to to survive on his own for a while, Hurley fell in with a group of traveling street performers. After several years of honing his craft as a comedian and acrobat, he was invited to the court to audition for the lord of the land. He excelled, playing jokes on the attendees at court, insulting the lord, demonstrating feats dexterity. He was hired on the spot.  </p><p>Since then, he has grown accustomed to the comfort of his life at court. While it is demanding and occasionally stressful, he has grown to love his job and uses his wit and wisdom to entertain the court and from time to time, to speak truth to power.</p>

      <p>Tony is the stereotypical pawn shop owner. He's sleazy, greedy and ill-tempered. But if you're looking for stolen goods or to sell something in a pinch, Tony's your go to guy. You're never going to get a lot for what you're selling, and you're going to pay way to much for anything you're buying, but he'll definitely get you what you need, no questions asked. Tony is well known in the underworld and a card carrying member of the local thieves' guild. He's a pretty big fish, but he's definitely a bottom feeder.</p>

      <p>Methuselah "Thuse" Cade may be one of the greatest investigators in the world. She began her career as military police, learning investigation and interrogation techniques in addition to her martial training. After her military obligation was done, she left and became a Watch Detective.</p><p>She quickly established a reputation as one of the most thorough and effective investigators the ranks had ever seen, despite not necessarily doing so "by the book". Her unorthodox method ruffled many a feather in the ranks of the guard and city watch, as did her willingness to investigate any case till its conclusion. Even if that conclusion was her superiors, city or church officials.</p><p>One such investigation involving several missing children pointed to a local temple and she was murdered for her trouble. Thuse is a Revenant. Returning from the dead with a mandate to hunt and reek vengeance on child killers. In the meantime, she takes any cases she finds interesting to pass the time.</p.

    background-story: |
      <p>Foreatha is a Wood Elf of around 400 years old. She has devoted the better part of her life to serving the stars and the Gods of Nature and learning the healing arts.  Daily, she comes in from the nearest forest to open her stall in the market square with fresh herbs to help and heal as many people as she can. She does charge for most of her services as they require time, materials and she does need money to survive, but her prices for herbs, lotions and potions are very reasonable and she has pretty much anything someone looking for that sort of thing can ask for.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Glohrimoore is a smith, born and bred, but not what one might imagine from a hard-working Mountain Dwarf. While fully committed to his Deity, Moradin [Any central Dwarven Deity], he sees the forge more so in terms of its dependence upon fire and light. As a youngster, he was always fascinated with the forging processes, but his attention was more focused on how fire and light were the central mechanism for the greatest creations. He turned his attention away from weapon and armor crafting and instead towards the construction of the finest lanterns for travellers, city streets, and beyond.</p>

<i>Staff
    - simple weapon
    - melee weapon

3 lb.</p><p>1d6 bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)</p></i><p>
This slender
    - hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells.

While holding the staff
    - you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

The staff has 10 charges
    - which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand
    - you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class's spell list: mage armor (1 charge) or shield (2 charges). No components are required.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge
    - roll a d20. On a 1
    - the staff shatters and is destroyed.

Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>With nothing but selfish goals, Wureok joined the local guild of Magic Arts and, with his exceptional cunning and charisma, worked his way into an internship with the castellan at the time. Using his raw magicks and ability to influence others, he ousted the castellan by convincing the noble family they served that he was an imposter - a foreigner looking to undermine their power.</p> <p>Gaining the trust of the royals over decades and generations, Wureok has, at least on the surface, appeared to be an exemplary court official. He watches over the castle and surrounding villas with great attention to detail; especially when it comes to collecting taxes and scutage.</p><p>Wureok has organized a growing rebel faction among the peasants and townsfolk, using the pressures he himself applies to turn them against his benefactor, then twisting the stories of uprisings in reports to his benefactor. He thereby presents further reason for his position, for the further exploitation of the common-folk, and for the royal family to further insulate themselves from the outside world.</p>

      <p>Grien has survived and witnessed many wars, local and national, in her 700 odd years. Over this time, she's grown tired of seeking wealth and those who subscribe to such a lifestyle. She's also abandoned religion and the Gods around which that institution has been fashioned, often jokingly dismissing them as nothing other than hallucinations of madmen in search of power</p><p>Over her many years she has gathered near perfect skills as an herbalist, practicing doctor, and distiller of fine salves, ointments, and potions. She is rarely without the support and oversight of her three assistants: Yemen, a young half-orc woman ostracized by her tribe who reveres Grien's wisdom and abilities; Tsk, an aging Kenku who has sworn his life to Grien for the healing she provided him when he suffered from a major medical condition; and Miles, a warforged veteren of the militia who fled the military of the nearby region and found peace and solace in Grien's teachings and in service to her and her shop.</p><p>Grien sells medicinal goods, potions, chemicals, and provisions of all sorts.</p>

      <p>While there is little known about their origins, Ronn <i>appears</i> as a middle-aged adult human male. Yet there are numerous questions and myths that swirl throughout the realms as to their origins. See, Ronn is far too well-read and intelligent to be of mundane or mortal origins. They have accrued such a wealth of knowledge and capacity to teach others that most merchants, even nobles, covet their abilities and - especially - their satchel</p><p>Consequently, They have learned to ensure their own safety by enlisting the help of adventurers and mercenaries to protect them. Their guidelines for their protectors is to maintain distance as not to gain unwanted attention, to permit free movement, and to not scare off the inquisitive; whom they welcome with open arms.</p><p>Ronn has a serious wanderlust, rarely staying in one town, city, or village for more than a week or two to spread their love of knowledge and accumulate even greater wealth.</p><p>Asexual and, in fact, without any noticeable confirmation of biological sex, they request that others use a variety of always changing pronouns when addressing them.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Kobolds are kobolds. Well, not always.</p><p>Symmetry (not her birth name) was raised in a cavern den of the hundreds of kobolds making up the clan of Kut-Kut.  They were dedicated to serving the Red Dragon, Vys, who lived deeper in the mountain. Vys would task the clan with securing the cavern tunnels and with raiding nearby trading routes for treasures to pile atop his horde. One evening, Vys heard her singing and demanded she sit atop his horde for the rest of her life to entertain him.</p><p>Not a great deal in the mind of anybody, really, even a kobold, and Symmetry (again, not her birth name, but she won't tell) grew disenfranchised with her life with Vys and her clan's unwillingness to stand up to the tyrant dragon. Vys would sleep often and would wake easily. He abhorred her silence and would punish her for it. She found a cunning solution.</p><p><i>"Vys, you want newer songs? You must be getting bored of the ones I know"</i>, she whispered in his ear in draconic.</p><p><i>"Yes,"</i> the dragon's deep growl trembled the piles of gold and treasures, <i>"I am."</i> The dragon chuckled sardonically.</p><p><i>"Well, I must read to learn new songs. And to read I must be quiet."</i></p><p><i>"Ay. Then silence for an hour." </i>The great red dragon purred.</p><p>Symmetry (again, I insist <i>not her birth name</i>) took an hour each day to learn more songs, more spells, and more knowledge from the tomes and treasures that littered Vys' lair.</p><p>When a commanding officer of the Kut-Kut tribe rushed in one day to alert Vys that a small party of heroes had breached the cave depths, chaos ensued. Little did Vys know, this was a ruse created by a small group of rebels who sought to escape the caverns. In the ensuing chaos, Symmetry was able to distract Vys with songs and aid in their escape.</p><p>The small kobold crew bonded over the weeks of travel that followed and set their sites on using their abilities to gain their own wealth. Upon arriving in a nearby city, they set forth to 'relieve' the population of their wealth. On a night of rest in a removed alleyway, Symmetry's song of her groups' exploits was overheard by a beggarly human who knew the value of being able to aid in disbanding this group of bandits and, perhaps even more so, the value of informing the watch as to the location of Vys' lair. He turned the information over for a handsome reward.</p><p>The Regional Watch found the band of kobolds with haste. Symmetry was a primary target with her bright clothes and distinct appearance. However, using the secrets found in Vys' lair, Symmetry was able to terrify the Watchman and escape. The rest of her band scattered.</p><p>Symmetry has been in flight ever since and makes a good living from selling her secrets - via letter - to the Regional Watch; sending them on wild goose chases.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Although still highly spiritual and loyal to his tribe at his core, Afar's time with the tinkering Hill Gnomes of Riddiruck Falls changed him. Always a bright Tabaxi, he was never given the chance to realize his true calling until introduced to tinkering. When his nomadic tribe came upon the village and befriended the genius gnomes, it wasn't long before AFar bid farewell to his tribe in favor of studying the arts of technology and artifice. He stayed in the village late into his life and was a collaborator on many of their greatest cityscape inventions. As old age set in, so did senility of sorts. Although still highly skilled and able to apply himself to his processes of invention, he has become a sort of wandering Don Quixote figure. </p><p>This inventor cat-man with scruffy beard, pronounced tabard, bronze morion, and iron mastiff, is looking to bring light to the lives of others through his wild inventions. With his natural charm accented by his 'lost kitty' Quixotic creativity, he has established himself as a local merchant who incomprehensibly wheels and deals in his inventions and other remarkable goods. He is always rummaging through the city garbage and will never turn down purchasing 'trade-in' oddities and 'another man's garbage'.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Lrryk is a former bandit leader and co-conspirator in a region-wide organized crime syndicate. His renown as "Tarback" is prolific. Yet his capture and consequent imprisonment redirected his values and life-goals</p><p>In the harsh prisons of Eldon's Passing [any remote town largely designed <i>around</i> its prison] Lrryk was faced with many of the ne'er-do-wells he had mistreated on the outs. Forced to make a moral and psychic shift, he befriended some common correction guards and proved to them that his transformation was genuine. It was these corrections officers that taught him the use of the glaive and the value of subduing his enemies rather than murdering them.</p><p>When Lrryk was done his time he sought out a small fortune he hid in an abandoned mining camp. With these funds he commissioned the building of his inn and tavern, "the Roost", where he now lives a life of stability with very little tolerance for crime or aspects of 'the Life'.</p>

      <p>Built <i>by</i> moneylenders <i>for</i> moneylenders, many of the battlepriests of Waukeen [or similar deity of trade and commerce] are warforged imbued with the spirit of trade and venture capitalism. While the positions of high-priests remain largely the province of avaricious humans and elves, some warforge have proven their 'mettle', so-to-speak, and climbed the ranks of the clergy.</p><p>The entire population of this church are garbed in ridiculously lavish clothing. Cure has embraced this practice...well...religiously. Since his creation he has fervently advocated the expansion of the Empire's commerce and investments, fought valiantly alongside his brothers-in-faith to protect merchant caravans, and bled speech after speech upon visiting commoners about the values of donating their lands and services to the temple for the betterment of the 'Great Machine', as they call it.</p><p>These abbots and priests and their followers can often be found in prayer to the Marketplace Eternal in the Outlands.</p><p>Cure is a fanatical follower of High Priest <a href="https://getvibrantgames.com/npc2/morion-defaye/">Morion DeFaye</a> and will almost always accompany him, whether on a trip to guard a caravan or in a ritual and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal.</p>

      <p>Gleadric was raised in a Firbolg stronghold in the remote forests of Yyl on the outskirts of known civilization. The pivoting day in his youth, when his shamanic calling took control of his dreams and appended them to his woken life, was nearly crippling at first; changing him from the day-to-day gentle tenderer to flora into a seemingly secretive tanner and collector of furs.</p><p><i>"You've changed."</i> One of his closest friends imparted, <i>"but...change is life."</i> He patted Gleandric on the back while Cujuloa continued stripping a large Bison of it's hide.</p><p>Gleadric became two spirits inhabiting one physical body. Cujuloa was largely in charge of his daily productive activities - invoking dreams in his waking life and providing soft, warm dreams to his peoples - while Gleadric remained in control of his interactions with his community. However, Cujuloa demanded that they take their firm beliefs in equality and profound spirituality to the civilized communities and that they find new means and ways to bring peoples back to the basic love of for flora and fauna. They believe that by building room in the market for impressive hide and fur trade - a return to more primitive and anarchic ways - while impressing the importance of adhering to dreams over the purported reality of the waking world; that this will bring peoples back to their essential being.</p><p>Their goals, along with their split psyche, make social appearances, well, a challenge in situations relying on a finely detailed social contract. They come across to most as wild or 'crazy', but upon closer inspection and interactions, their distilled spirituality leaves a mark of genuine good.</p><p>Depending on which spirit is taking charge, they refer to themselves in 3rd person - either Gleadric or Cujuloa.

    background-story: |
      <p>Raised by an abusive human adopted father, Hylinn developed numerable psychological complexes. Her self-esteem and normally natural capabilities as an elf were largely lost during this train-wreck of an upbringing. Abandoning her in a marketplace when she was barely into her teen years certainly didn't help with any of these damages.</p><p>In order to survive, she took up the first available opportunity to support herself - a role as boatswain on a questionable ship of ne'er-do-wells. Over the course of a number of voyages, she realized these 'sailors' were second-rate pirates who would plunder minor textile and fabric shipments or something of equally laughable financial gain. The crew were, surprisingly, abusive - especially with her - and her disorders compounded. Fatter and drunker, Hylinn returned to land-based civilization as a quarter of half the person she might have been. But not without the Captain of the crew plucking out her right eye as a prize and also a punishment for abandoning the ship. </p> <p>Taking up various custodial and service jobs wherever she could in order to survive, or, rather, subsist, Hylinn focused most of her frustrations into her love for a good drunk and fatty foods. Her numerous disorders, perhaps too many to count, helps haughty and self-centered patrons feel better about themselves and thus drives a decent amount of business to the barstools in the tavern at which she works - "the Dull Dragoon".</p>

      The very glee and dedication that characterize the Gnomish race is exemplified in Cador. His clan were always obsessed with tinkering and the creation of various gadgets for adventurers' utility, but Cador took this to a new level when he established his inn, "the One Stop". Here he has conjoined his love for respite with his natural proclivity for tinkering. With numerous 'washers' and 'drylines', he offers guests a laundry service for a nominal fee.He has also created what he calls the 'barstop' for his common room. This complex of tubes and steel resembles a 'Hooka' and allows visitors to choose a particular beverage of their choice and have it poured for them. All they need is the receptacle, which are offered in stacks beside the 'barstop'. Cador is currently working on something that will also clean his dish and glassware.Consistently showing off his innovations he is also open to help and feedback on them and on any ideas others might have for providing even better hospitable service to his guests.

    background-story: |
      <p>The racial mixing between Elves and Humans is no mystery. The two races, each believing themselves the noblest in the realms, inevitably settled in the same regions and would inter-marry. The DeFeywilde family are an example of how the nobles of each racial lineage sought to establish a peaceful and lasting bond through the creation of a mutually beneficial political and racial ideology that served the best interests of both humans and elves.</p><p>Pyc has cultivated this lineage and pursued the proliferation of peace throughout the realm. She has been taught that nobility is not a birthright, but something established through action and self-presentation. Her clan would labor over textiles and fabrics to develop a standard of regal dress that they believed ought to be held by all members of the kingdoms. She doesn't frown on those who aren't well-kempt, nor does she sympathize. Rather, she genuinely empathizes with those who have resigned themselves to the 'less finer' things in life and advocates for the vital role that one's self-presentation takes in daily activities and overall destiny.</p>

      <p>Orcish raids certainly aren't limited to Western Realms. As the orcs expand their grip on the land through broad diasporas above and below ground, the far-east has experienced similar challenges. Plunder, pillage, bloodshed, and, unfortunately, rape, are all among the impacting factors.</p><p>Reed is a product of these raids. Raised in a semi-noble house of militant samurai, Reed's natural abilities became apparent to his family and their samurai masters. He was a natural fit for their training and military crusades.</p><p>Over time, Reed's clan spread far and wide in their explorations and claims to various regions. His soul has become that of a wanderer. Make no mistake, however, because Reed is not a Ronin. He stands devout in his devotion to his family and their military objectives, acting as a diplomat, messenger, and trader of their fine goods.</p><p>Often receiving mass imports from his home, he busies his days refining and sophisticating his market booth and managing his inventory to best provide an authentic experience of his culture.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Trileah grew up in a somewhat traditional halfling family, except they lived in a clan who had imbricated themselves into broader civilization and, consequently, couldn't exactly follow those traditions as they normally might have. A family of artists and musicians might <i>sound</i> fun, but it was all the sound that She reflects on with contempt.</p><p>Trileah was born with a strange condition that impacted her body's finer functions: growing hair, sensory perception, etcetera. Her hair would grow in clumps and sometimes not at all. Her senses are not heightened but, rather, highly irritable. Particularly her ears. This didn't bode well in a noisy household and she grew a serious disdain for loud noises.</p>

    - <p><b>Broken Pocket Watch</b> - <i>
Wondrous item
    - very rare
    - requires attunement</i>
It’s rare to find a pocket watch at all outside of gnomish settlements. This one seems to be broken
    - as it sometimes skips back a few seconds. It holds great power for the one who attunes it
    - though. The broken pocket watch has 3 charges. On your turn
    - you can spend 1 charge to take an additional bonus action
    - as the pocket watch ticks back by two seconds to give you another moment for something quick. The pocket watch regains 1 expended charge at dawn
Alternately
    - you can force it to turn backward as far as it can go. This does not require an action and takes 3 charges. You can’t do this if you are incapacitated. You teleport to any location you have been earlier in this turn
    - you regain any hit points you have lost since the beginning of your turn
    - and you can immediately take another turn. The pocket watch falls apart after that
    - and require 1 week of specialized repairs. If this last ability is chosen
    - after 1 minute
    - you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p><p><b>Dagger of Warning</b> - Most rogues shouldn't really need help with their perception
    - but this dagger helps both the rogue and everyone around them. While attuned
    - the rogue can't be surprised and are magically awoken from their sleep when danger approaches—along with all allies within 30 feet of them. Not to mention the dagger gives the rogue advantage on initiative rolls
    - which is a valuable thing for them to have.</p>

      <p>The <i>Lion's Mane Tavern</i> is a charming local destination location. Well-kept with superb staff, it has a firm grip on the business of the community and its proprietor, Leo, has their respect.</p><p>Leo's tavern is more than a reputable destination location, it is also the center for his organized crime syndicate, the Lythiad Assembly. Composed primarily of Leo's extended family but including myriad community officials and mercants, the Assembly doesn't perform what Leo calls, 'Brutish Outlaw' work, but instead is highly surgical in their activities. Kidnapping, smuggling, and political terrorism are the Assembly's professional province.</p><p>Leo and his two brothers and one sister are carrying on the business of their father and uncles. Just how long the Assembly has been operating remains lore lost in history. Leo claims they've operated for centuries and span well-beyond the region. While there are some facts to corroborate this (and the local militia are certainly investigating), the evidence for this is lacking.</p>

      <P>Johannes grew up in a middle class family and never really had to work hard for anything. He spent a fair amount of time in pubs and taverns as a teen and eventually just fell into working in them. </p><p>His elf side gives him a natural dexterity for flare bartending and showmanship. As handsome and skilled as he is, he's become a very popular attraction at the local bars and makes a very good living for a drink slinger.</p><p> He loves being an attraction and leans into showing off, and the ladies eat it up. He is smart enough to pay attention to what is going on around him and can be a valuable source of information if he can be briefly pulled away from his entertaining the bar crowd.</p>

      <p>Having been trained as a mason as a young dwarf, at just over 300 years old, Dewarn is about as good at his job as they come. He's fast, skilled and thorough as a mason with a masters eye for detail.  He is however, also a heavy drinker and that has taken it's toll on his dexterity has slowly begun to fade as he's advanced in age. He is a true master of his craft, but these days he's better off teaching the youngsters than doing the work himself.</P>

      <p>Lucertia is the proud owner of The Verada Inn. Unlike most Inns, The Verada doesn't have a tavern attached, it's just an Inn. She prides herself on having clean comfortable rooms at a reasonable price and does good business here.  The bulk of her income, however, comes from her harem of escorts. </p><p>The Verada has a reputation as something of a "No tell, Motel". Lucretia is a stern mistress who runs a tight ship and wont take any crap from anybody. She's been at this game for a long time and knows exactly what she's doing. While friendly and gracious with customers, she won't accept any disrespect and has "security" on hand at all times to handle any problem customers or if necessary, escorts.</p>

      <p>Llewellyn is a very old man, even by elf standards. He's spent much of his life travelling around the realms collecting books and studying lore. As he grew too old for the life of an adventurer, he settled in the city and opened a store to display and pass on his huge collection.</p><p>  He is always interested in bringing in new lore and historical volumes, and can become distracted and talk at lengths about history, lore and arcana. To him, knowledge is it's own reward.</p><p> During his travels he has collected a number of magical tombs and scrolls which he keeps under lock and key at the shop. A player would have to heavily impress him to sell one of them though, and even then, they would be very expensive.</p>

      <p>Hercule is the owner/operator of Hercule's Curiosity Shop. Having tried his hand at several careers throughout his lifetime, including briefly attempting to school for sorcery, he found that he excelled at sales. Using the contacts he made through his brief schooling, he created his current personae and opened his curiosity shop.</p><p> Most of the goods he carries are minor magic trinkets of no real use to anyone, but he also carries and extensive stock of materials used for the various schools of spellcasting. From holy symbols to spellbook materials, Hercule's carries it all. Now and again, he does actually manage to procure some useful magic items for sale, but those are few and far between.</p>

      <p>Corbrin is a decorated military veteran of the feared order of echo knights. He lost his arm quelling and insurrection against the government by Drow rebels. After losing his arm, he no longer felt capable of front-line military service. He was still a capable fighter and knew his weapons and armor well and spent some time training new recruits to the military.</p><p> After that he moved to the City Watch and continued training younger recruits. Eventually he decided it was time to retire from service and live quiet and stress-free for the rest of his life. To that end, he took a job working for an old friend of his, selling arms and armor from his provisions shop. He is knowledgeable and friendly despite his appearance and enjoys imparting his knowledge on anyone willing to listen.</p>

      <p>Enid is a pretty regular young lady just trying to get by. Married off by her family at a young age to an older man. It wasn't long before her husband started abusing her. She did her best to hide the abuse and just go on with her life, but as the years went by, he got worse and worse.</p><p> Finally, in a feat of self-defense, she smothered him in his sleep one night. She did her best to make his death look like an accident, and once he was in the ground, she left her home town and her family and has never looked back. She took one of the only jobs she was qualified for in the new town, and now sells fruit for a grocery company in the market square. It's a job. It pays her bills, and most importantly, she's free of him!</p>

      <p>Abandoned as a child and raised in orphanages, he had an early pension for catching and dissecting small animals. As he got older he found out he could do that for a living without people shunning him for it.</p><p>He found a kindly butcher in town and became his apprentice. He took to the trade light lightning and quickly far surpassed the abilities of his mentor. When it came time for his mentor to retire, Orfthall took over the business and has excelled. However, as skilled as Orfthall is, he's not immune to the fluctuations of the market and has from time to time, passed off lesser meats as better cuts, especially in his sausage.</p>

      <p><i>Darius DeManque's Glorius and Wondrous Traveling Show</i> was a well-known and loved troupe of traveling performers, freaks, musicians, and various purveyors of oddities. A runaway from an orphanage for boys, Clyde took his leave when the traveling show was passing through town, hiding amongst the crates and supplies for the curio shop.</p><p>Quickly becoming well-versed in the amazing oddities they had available, Clyde felt he found a new home and fit in nicely as the years passed. Unfortunately, the troupe and nearly all of their sets and goods were consumed by a flash grass fire while they camped. Clyde barely managed to escape on the smoking curio carriage; albeit badly burned, losing the use of an eye, and traumatized.</p><p>Doing his best at covering up the damages to the carriage and at keeping alive the spirit of the traveling troupe, Clyde Goodeye travels the countryside attempting to bring color and wonder to others while seeking more and more trinkets and curiosities for his stash.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Because of the imposing austerity of the Winterlands, the Orcs of the North, the Grimfang tribe, are known for being especially vicious. Lines of berserkers, polar bear cavalries, and powerful shamans have carved bloody paths of devastation into the surrounding kingdoms.</p><p> Unknown to the broader public, the Grimfang tribe has derived their ruthlessness from a desire to protect themselves from the strategic and unethical assaults of the Northern Dwarven and Elven alliances.</p><p> Separated from his tribe during a heavy skirmish, Deonne was held and tortured by the Inquisitors of the North seeking the hearth of the King of the Grimfang. Tortured over and over without giving up any information, he was abandoned for dead. Trudging through the bitter winter landscape, he eventually found a family of traveling merchants who took pity on the cowering, shivering youth hidden off the side of a trading route. They took him in as an adopted son.</p><p>Eventually finding Solace in the Church of the Poet of Justice [Hoar or some similar God of Revenge], Deonne has since committed his life to gaining retribution for the little known evils of the allied nations. While this serves as his over arching life-goal, he has settled himself into a rewarding juxtapositional life of providing comfort and respite to travelers of the Realms, dwarves and elves alike, to offer the comfort and compassion that he and his peoples never received.</p><p>Noble in presence, Deonne is committed to a life governed by natural law and the order civilization brings to the masses. Although resentful of the factions responsible for the unethical treatment of his tribe, he recognizes that town and city officials must bring order for their people, and he believes that religious factions are more capable of this than politicians and magistrates.</p>

      Merrick comes from a long line of tanners and leather workers. The skills have been passed down through generations of his family along with the leather working magic his great great grandfather developed.  He works hard and loves his work. He takes great pride in the quality and beauty of his work. He lovingly trains his twin boys in the family trade. Not only is he an immaculate craftsman, he is also a shrewd businessman. He knows the quality of his work and will not be swayed on his prices. His prices aren't unreasonable, but they are definitely not on the cheaper end

    background-story: |
      Yoloff has had a long and decorated career with the watch and is just waiting for his retirement pension to kick in so he can putter around his home full time. He knows the city like the back of his hand and has pretty much sen it all. Despite his comments to the contrary, he actually enjoys and takes pride in training and keeping the rookies safe on the job. Due to his advanced age, most of his duties consist of training and crowd control on the few days that he gets away from pushing paper at his desk at Watch HQ. He's been a good watchman for a long long time, but has been known to take the odd bribe to supplement his income as long, as it's not to ignore something that will directly hurt anyone.

      Warsoc's father leads a powerful and especially brutal war party of orcs. With little stomach for the violence of his clan, he abandoned a raiding party in his young teens and made his way to town. He found that his tribe had lied and he wasn't immediately hated and feared for his heritage, In return, he decided he would defend his new home. When he came of age, he joined The Watch. He's a rookie and not very confident in his skills, smarts or anything else really, but his trainer and sergeant think he's slowly becoming a good watchman. He is loyal and earnest but not very assertive for an officer, but he's working on it. Since he was part of a war-band for most of his youth, he has developed an affinity for the children's toys he was denied as a child and has amassed quite a collection in his small barracks room

    background-story: |
      Leaving her home in the Underdark after her parents murder by surface-dwelling adventurers, she seeks revenge against all Up-worlders. Using her families contacts, she gained entrance and raining from the Assassin's Guild. With her stunning good looks, ruthless aggression and lack of moral norms, she developed the personae of a courtesan and escort. This allows her to get close, personal and passed the guard of her targets. Enjoying the more carnal side of her nature, she does continue to work as an escort when the assassin work is slow, and she's not out hunting the adventurers that murdered her family. She has sworn to hunt and kill those that killed her family and uses most of her spare time and money to accomplish that goal

    background-story: |
      After coming of age in Adar and seeing the threats posed by the Dreaming Dark and the Riedra, Narmanaleth fled out into the world to hide, fight back and follow the path of a shaman. Using his Quori spirit to help him connect with other spirits of other realms, he became very adept and after years of practicing, very powerful in his chosen path. He speaks with and for the spirits. In addition to using his power to combat the forces of the Dreaming Dark on the astral plane, he will also seek out heroes and adventurers to help them find their path at the spirit's behest. He is very old and very tired now, his battle is almost done and he's looking for those who would follow in his footsteps to impart his knowledge. Like most of his kind, he has bouts of madness caused by his twin spirit, but they are much fewer and further between as he's gotten older.

      Kablam's earliest memory is the explosion that took her family. After wandering the wilderness on her own for a while, she made her way into the city. While trying to steal some food for herself, she was scouted and recruited by members of the local Thieve's Guild. Knowing of the nature Kenku, she was quickly trained to perform various services for the guild. Her quick fingers make her an excellent pickpocket, her mimicry makes her an excellent spy and forger. She does as she's told and she does it well.

      Looking for a way to gather more treasure for their tribe, Hugh Mann had the brilliant idea of pretending to be a human to infiltrate their society and steal treasure from the inside. It's not going very well for them, but at least they've been able to move about town without attracting too much attention

    background-story: |
      A well-traveled adventurer, guide and line-slinger, Nahkirin knows the canyons and mountains of Zendikar like the back of her hand. Like most Zendikari who lived through the Eldrazi war, she has been to hell and back and has the scars to prove it. Having lost so much and so many, she is reluctant let anyone new into her life. Between her adventuring and the war, she has found many passes through places that few have ever found their way through and marked the trails in her clan colors. She is an expert guide and always happy to get out of Seagate into the wilderness, even if it means guiding strangers to their destination. Before the war, she was a follower of the goddess Kamsa and a member of her order, but the likeness of her goddess now bares to much of a resemblance to the Eldrazi Titans for her to have any faith left. She has abandoned her order but still maintains the skills she has learned and has translated them into her daily life as a guide and adventurer

    background-story: |
      A shining son of the Sunmane Pride, Brygan is a fierce warrior, hunter and tracker. Specifically trained to hunt and defend against Hydras and Nxyborn creatures, he is vicious when battling them. He sees these things as abominations, affronts to his god and a threat to his pride. At home with his family, he is loving and gentle with his wife and cubs. He is a leader of his pride and heads up the scouting force. At times, especially while on the hunt, he can be very arrogant and sometimes gets too far ahead of his squad, getting himself into trouble.

      The swamp community that Slizz'nek lives in has become an important port city at a river delta  bordering a large lake between nation-states, much to the chagrin of the local lizardfolk population. But as always, his tribe adapts. Taking a job on the docks to show the "softskins" what a "real male" is.  He's gruff, uncultured and temperamental, but he works hard and makes enough to afford all of the food that he can eat. Not being terribly bright and generally having a disrespect the government that has overtaken his lands, he can easily be bribed to help out with smuggling operations at the docks

      Vrakoom's family has a long tradition of serving as clerics of the Selesnya Conclave and started his training at a young age. Growing up in the light of Trostani, he is a true believer and has strong faith in the teachings of the conclave. These teachings are where he derive's his power. 
      Large, even for a loxodon, he was groomed as a front line healer and has seen his fair share of battles for his young age (about 70 years old), mostly against Gruul raids, but also during the War of the Spark. As a result, he is as competent with a a mace and shield as he is with a healing hand

      Kailanno is an accomplished and well-traveled guide and adventurer. He knows the major rivers of Zendikar like the back of his hand. He was a follower of the Cosi Creed and followed the path of Cosi the Trickster God. Unfortunately, with the arrival of the Eldrazi and resulting war for the survival of Zendikar, it was revealed that Cosi was not a God, but one of the Eldrazi Titans; Kozilek.  This revelation has cause the bulk of Zendikar's merfolk to abandon their gods, but Kailanno still maintains many of his beliefs and habits, despite no longer believing in Cosi himself. Because of this, he enjoys playing sleight of hand tricks, card tricks and even stealing small baubles and trinkets from the people he's guiding. This has gotten him in trouble more than once

      Tanarolf loves his job. He works hard under the premise that he's keeping order and loyally doing his duty to his city and nation. But what he really loves is the feeling of power and control that it gives him and the opportunity to take out his naturally aggressive tendencies on his prisoners. He is a petty man with a quick temper, but he's also a bit of a coward when he's not in charge of the situation. Like most bullies, he will quickly back down and turn to self-preservation when presented with an actual threat. He is strong and a natural fighter but will run rather than fight if he thinks he's outmatched.

      Slith'Kyrin has been trained since birth to be her people's next High Priestess of Bahamut. Still very young by her people's standards, she is full of self-doubt and questions, but is slowly coming into her own. She is strong and beautiful and very intelligent and knows how to play her role well. However, she has a dark and terrible secret; her race's creator, former patron, and still current patron of their sister race the Yuan-Ti, Zehir speaks to her. A dark reptilian old god, full of rage and hunger, Zehir wants his chosen people back from Bahamut. He fills her head with hunger and dark thoughts. She knows he is wrong and was a cruel master to her people, but she struggles to keep his seductive words from her mind as her power grows.

      Dimri, or Clodhopper as his friends call him, (and everyone is his friend) is the life of the party. And in satyr society, that's saying something! Friendly, outgoing, gregarious and boisterous, he has never met a wine he wouldn't drink or a creature he wouldn't sleep with. He lives for the revels and despite being an accomplished musician, would rather lead the crowd in a traditional singalong, than pursue an actual career in it. If it's not part of the party, he's just not interested, though he will happily share his life's philosophy with anyone who will listen

    background-story: |
      <p>The high elves of the Northern Expanse have remained stoic in their pursuit of peace with the surrounding Nations. This is exemplified in their various treatises. Hailing from this environment sounds near idyllic and its peoples destined for greatness in politics. Well, perhaps only half of this is true.</p><p>Over her 150 years, for sure, Libil has achieved political prominence in the regional Merchants's Guild. She has been an important figure in the negotiations between the various increasingly expanding trading companies that threatened to put a stranglehold on individual merchants. Libil established, nearly single-handedly, the regulations for these companies and the available guilds for the individual merchants on the ground.</p><p>Libil's upbringing among the purportedly peaceful High Elves should bespeak the formation of a law-abiding character. Her knowledge of their inner-workings led her astray from this destiny. Instead, Libil learned that the High Elves, out of survival or desperation, had been conducting various unethical surgical strikes against surrounding Nations; unethical because they betrayed the expectations of the treatises and were kept out of the public eye. This led Libil to pursue the art of inquisition, of unearthing the truth of a situation, and drove her in a long-standing bid as High Journeyman of the Regional Thieves' Guild. Instead of abiding by laws that seemed to only mask the horrible truths that underpin the appearance of peace, She seeks to achieve true peace and stability for 'boots on the ground' through the unionization structures that guilds bring.</p><p>She can often be found in the busiest marketplaces of large towns and cities, directing traffic, solving squabbles, and enlisting merchants to join the guild (both Merchants' and Thieves' (the latter often referenced, instead, as 'Workers' Guild', or 'Commoners' Association', or something of that ilk)).</p>

    background-story: |
      Amera is considerably older than she appears to be. Around 200 years old, though in appearance they are around 25. Urban sprawl forced them from their cliff-side home. As a result they took up a job as a sailor allowing them to travel and be constantly on the move. They also regularly change ships and crews as often as possible to prevent people from learning the truth about what they are. They will usually serve as both a lookout and entertainment on the ships, they will also occasionally function as a companion for the ships captain if the mood takes them. If they need to, they can transform and escape from a situation underwater. They're main goal is their own continued survival as well as mating and perpetuating it's species

      Moonglow grew up wild and eventually made her way into town. She always loved dancing and quickly found that she could make a very good living as a dancer at the gentlemen's clubs in the city. She found that she could further supplement her income by providing some extra services at the clubs.  Approached by the Thieve's Guild, she received a little bit of training and began to make even more money by collecting information from her customers and passing that information to the guild. Her exotic appearance and talent, have made her one of the favorites performers in town, and being very popular has made gathering information.

      Klarion is a simple man who grew up on his own, living off of the land. As his gifts with plants and fungi grew, he was able to secure work as the gardener and groundskeeper for the large estate at the edge of town. He's good at his job and loves to work with the gardens. He's done a sufficient enough job that he gets very little interference from his boss and mostly does what he wants. He rarely goes into town proper and deals with other people as little as possible

    background-story: |
      <p>Hailing from the far coasts, Xo grew up in a migratory tribe of wise tortles. This tribe obsessed over the kinds of blades and weapons that could possible harm them and, as such, developed their skills at crafting fine weapons, grinding, and all trades associated with these processes.</p><p>Xo was no different from the other members of his tribe. Except that he is the only remaining son of the chief of his migratory tribe. He remains in close contact with the other members of his community but has realized that most of his tribe aspire to travel or to grow their skills and wealth. As the heir apparent, Xo realized he would have to take up the mantle of his tribe and advance their interests. He seeks no such advancement but instead simply to 'get by'. The 'simple life'. This, to Xo, is more enjoyable. Particularly when one can help others and interact with the diverse array of peoples that frequent a marketplace.</p><p>He now operates primarily as a grinder and sells various accoutrements from his cart. These range from collectibles, like bells or miniatures, to pragmatic items, like pitons or adventuring packs.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>As a high priest of Waukeen [or any other God of Civilization or Mercantile/Capitalist Communities], Morion believes in the power of venture capitalism, mercantile culture, and clear divisions of labour. He is a champion of this clergy and a warrior for its causes. He grew up in a High Elven community committed to the establishment of the ideals that insist that 'civilized' societies <i>must</i> rely on a clear division of labor; a clarity which can only be achieved by relying on the power of wealth as the primary feature for division.</p><p>To these clergy, trade of coin and goods is central to maintaining law and order and, as such, the church has dedicated champions to protecting marketplaces, caravans, and any other vectors for the spread of capitalism. They have established powerful 'armies' of warrior abbots and priests, adorned in lush tunics of grey and white highlighted with rare coins sewn into the fabrics</p><p>Morion has spent his many years dedicated to this clergy. Battling surrounding nations as a warrior priest, He has gained notoriety for his ruthlessness and divinely imbued abilities. Even within the hierarchy. These clergy literally battle one on one for advancement to the upper echelons. And Morion has gained a reputation as a dangerous opponent and dedicated member of the community.</p><p>The upper clergy consist primarily of Elves and Humans while the lower echelons are made up of the same plus a large proportion of Warforged created by gifted High Elf and Human devout.</p><p>When he is not engaged in complex rituals and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal at the Mercantile Temple, Morion is most often found escorting high-value trade caravans through distant trade routes. He is often accompanied by a small battalion of warforged dedicated to the mercantile clergy. Morion is quite fond of one particular follower, <a href=https://getvibrantgames.com/npc2/cure/>Cure.</a></p>

      |
      <p>Life in the gnomish city of Aberash Caandu is always lively - filled with tinkerer products wobbling about and wondrous inventions that would amaze even the most experienced traveler. The gnomes of this city have always been accepting of all other races and inter-racial marriage and offspring are not uncommon. Portius is a product of this accepting community and raised in their meticulously productive and innovative cultural practices.</p><p>Knowing from their youth that they were not only a mixed-race person but also gender fluid, Portius presents powerful qualities of both masculinity and femininity. With close-cut cropped hair and a muscular, broad build, they seem tomboyish. Yet their graceful hands and attention to details - in their work, appearance, and environment - reflect a feminine edge.</p><p>As they matured, they took on the best of each race. They chose not to tinker, per se, at least not with 'inventions' but instead with the biology of peoples. They took to the role of a doctor easily and quickly became the community's go-to for anything that would ail them. They also picked up on the talents of the local Dwarven community and learned the sophisticated methods of rectification - distilling and producing fine spirits. In addition, their skills with a sharp edge and attention to detail leant themselves well to barbering. Portius was and is seen as something of a pragmatic polymath. The wonderful outcome of the mixing of Gnomish and Dwarven genetics and culture.</p><p>Portius has since set out on their own to pursue a greater good among the regions. She has settled in the city of Tyrwind [any large city] where they have set up a sturdy shack on the outskirts of the market. Their small shop operates as an underclass clinic. Here she also distills and bottles fine spirits for sale to taverns, inns, and the public. She has a brand called, "Moorehouse', made up of various rums and whiskeys.</p><p>Portius has since joined the regional Doctors' Guild, which has a small population of members. They have also been a founding member of the Rectifiers' guild. Both to protect practitioners of little-known and rarely practiced professions.</p><p>They seek to use their membership to these guilds to push them to dismantle - through strategically intellectual and political means - the mercantile churches. Because of these goals, she is currently a target of <a href="https://getvibrantgames.com/npc2/morion-defaye/">Morion DeFaye</a> and his clergy. Although these mercantile abbots would never outright assassinate anyone, they keep close watch over her operations.</p> <p>Although very gender fluid in their performance of gender, Portius' biological sex is female and her sexual preference oscillates frequently.</p>
