    background-story: |
      <p>Thane hails from the brewing town of Hemmelweist [Village/Town] in remote hills nestled within the vast mountain range of SimmeredAshes [Mountain Range]. His community were very kinship focused and taught him the value of offering hearth and home to those people among whom one lives. Cared for by multiple different members of this closeknit community, he gained a deep love for the 'commoner' - he or she that partakes in those daily activities that support a group and form its foundational infrastructure. He thusly also learned the various skillsets that complement such a vision: brewing, cooking, textile work. Creating fabulous rare brews of mountain apples and deephops or lush woven fabrics for bed linens and window dressings; these were the lively activities that colored his youth.</p>However, these beautiful products were being created during a time when neighboring mountain Dwarven cities, such as Kindlebrough and Cynd [Dwarven cities], and various Human settlements in the Eastern Plains [Broad Settled Expanse] were suffering from hunger and poverty. This wondrous pallette of the best aspects of Dwarven culture was suddenly disrupted after a pact was struck upon between these two communities - a pact for mutual expansion. A collective response was required from Thane's tribe and an aristocracy quickly formed as the village leaders were overcome with panic and sudden greed. Quickly rising in power, this group condensed to a few self-appointed leaders. They became tyrants in a matter of months, enforcing impossible laws that led to austere and deprived conditions. Families were broken and scattered. Vowing to one day return and bring his people back to their glory, Thane fled for weeks searching for a civilization within which to begin his life anew and share the ethical codes of his people with the world at large.</p>Thane's inborn work ethic gained traction with village markets and it wasn't long before he had accrued enough coin to begin planning to return to his people. His connections to the people with whom he resettled excite him at the potential that he will not return to his home alone.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p> Hilltop [Village; Town] is a quiet halfling town located on a well-used trade route. This has conditioned the population to become diverse in their skillsets and relatively wealthy overall - compared to other halfling settlements. With all the coming and going of people and voluminous exchange of coins, goods, and services, people can get lost. When people get lost and nobody comes looking for you, well, then what do you do? A lecherous and ornery halfling grain and feed merchant from the nearby economic centre of Invasaad [Major City] was traveling through Hilltop with his "best employees", his three young daughters. The girls would heave the sacks of grain and feed on and off the cart or sometimes would be responsible for interacting with immediate buyers. In one transaction, the feed had been hauled onto the buyer's cart whilst Stella - the youngest of the 3 sisters - was bargaining for the first time with a crotchety old woman who couldn't afford to feed her goats. </p><p>"I'll give ya two silver, nothin more! My husband has passed and we 'ad no children. I'm left to me own devices! 'Ave pity on an old lady". </p><p>Remembering how her father would deal abusively with her sisters whenever they returned with less than he expected, Stella continued to bargain. In the meanwhile, her father, who had grown tired of feeding a third child and who had resigned himself to cutting down the weakest buffalo, had carried on in the cart out of town. Stella continued to barter, none the wiser, until the argumentative customer wouldn't budge. She looked back for her father's approval and saw no cart, no father, no sisters. Stella ended the barter, panicked. She raced around town thinking that her father had other dealings. He was nowhere to be found. Young Stella wept in the square.</p><p>Eventually that evening a kind elderly halfling woman approached the weeping figure. She comforted her. Told her their were bigger problems. Bigger problems that needed solutions. The kind elderly halfling lady told Stella, "you're from where you choose to be from. You can be Stella of Hilltop". The name stuck and Stella quickly became a surrogate child to the people of Hilltop. Her father never did return.</p>

      <p> Lorne was raised in the SimmeredAshes [Large Mountain Range] Mountain range. His parents were devout worshippers of Hysdomman, the Father of Shields [Any powerful Central Dwarven God] and highly traditional. They were harsh on him, but fair, and always urged him to keep his hands busy in his own business, not others. As talented and renown smiths, his family were also able to offer Lorne a lush and more-than-comfortable lifestyle. He thus absorbed and internalized the priority of wealth and proprietorship.</p><p>Although among the upper class of his city, Lorne had watched his parents relentless toiling upon the anvils and forges. He learned that comfort is the result of long days of tireless labour. As his parents aged he began to take the roles of proprietor and designer of Stronghammer Arms. To this day, he swears by his name and lives for his brand</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Ezio’s people were a cult who worshipped one of the Great Old Ones, a Forgotten God. His family chose this because they witnessed the fascist matriarchical hierarchy of Lollth [Or similar Evil Drow God]. Alongside this, the tribe heard rumors and saw evidence that the Great Old Ones were on the rise to reclaim their positions of power over the material and astral planes. The great Jackal Irrt, the Lord of Hunger, Thirst, Famine, and Drought, and Moander, the Lord of Growth and Decay [Two Forgotten Gods] are separately surging forward into the hearts and minds of those in the underdark and those few clans who wander the middle-ground between the upperworld and the Underdark. Disaffected with fascist rulers, Ezio's tribe rejected and became fervent enemies of the ruling pantheons of the Underdark. Learning of the power and promise of the Forgotten Gods, Ezio's clan began offering faith and tithings to Ommen-Hurr [A different Forgotten God], the goddess of Shadow and Time.</p><p>Because of their growing size and relative power, other apostatic clans who followed other Old Gods became violent towards Ezio's tribe. One fateful night, the followers of Irrt summoned aspects of the deity to the material realm to strike. Massive jackals with gnashing teeth and almost rotted skin hanging loosely from their frames were unleashed on Ezio's village.</p><p>Demon hounds descended on the Underground city of Daur’zzwth (Dar-zooth) [or any Drow or Underdark village] that Ezio and his people called home. One of these great demon hounds sought out Ezio’s father and uncle especially, invaded their home, and assaulted the family. Ezio’s father, Ziirr’kho (Zee-rick-oh) and uncle Ras’klnn (Raz-kill- non) bravely fought the beast, bringing it near death, yet both Drow heroes were left close to death themselves. A young Ezio, terrified and protecting the youth in the basement of the home, silently dashed out of the cellar trap-door to grasp his father’s powerful shortsword. The demon hound circled, smelling victory, and, due to injury and pride, did not sense Ezio lurking in the shadows around the outside of the room. Drooling and snapping its jaws in naïve glee, the beast slowly approached the two men. Ezio leapt from the shadows and sunk the blade deep into the beasts eye, killing it. He’s since been a family hero. The tribe has taken it upon themselves to train him as an Assassin and Diplomat and send him forth into the Upperworld to cause chaos and make way for their rise to power.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Growing up as the son of a poor farmer can be hard as it is. Add alcoholism, abuse, and lecherous behaviors and you have the ingredients for an exploitative upbringing rife with imparted dysfunctional behaviors. Tristeth learned to put his focus on what he could control: whether or not small animals would live or die.</p><p>As this trope would suggest, Tristeth began with the family cat. He then began picking off birds with his slingshot. He would carefully examine these animals inside and out, learning their morphologies and organic composition. He would often bury the parts separately in what he, arbitrartily, deemed to be the "right spot".</p><p>Nobody ever really found out about his little hobby. He covered it up well by always having a variety of pets that he cared for. Eventually, Tristeth came of age where he had to choose between laboring on his father's farm or venturing out on his own to pursue a different trade. The choice wasn't hard. He hated living there, as much as he adored a few of his 7 brothers and sisters. He departed to a nearby village and volunteered for the coroner of the religious order of Selune [Any Moon or Good Goddess] and learned various respectful means of preparing bodies for burial or pyre. Because this religious Order preached the sanctity of bodies and spirits, he also began changing his overall attitude and strange hobbies. Eventually he worked his way into the position of gravekeeper for the Order and currently presides over their countryside sacred burial grounds. He and his one bastard son, abandoned by his mother, reside in the small townhouse next to the burial grounds.</p>[Optional] Tristeth is being exploited by Duergar Warlocks looking to sacrifice the bodies in the burial ground to an Evil Deity. Consequently, they have penetrated his mind and begun causing a sort of madness where Tristeth escapes to an astral realm that he calls, "the Chalk". The Warlocks essentially send his astral form to wander an endless expanse of near nothingness; only faint and fading chalk outlines of reality. In the chalk, he is faced with the spirits of those the Warlocks seek to sacrifice next. The victim convinces Tristeth to continue his supply of bodies. He then wakes, exhausted and wondering why sleep no longer provides him rest. He's begun talking to himself and exhibiting odd twitches and spasms due to exhaustion.</p>

      <p>Long escaped from the control of Mind Flayers, Zirrash'ka and his tribe also fled the plane of Limbo [Any non-material plane] and integrated themselves among villages of elves on the rim of known civilization. Quietly keeping to themselves and continuting their gratitude towards their patrons, his tribe thirsted for knowledge of the material plane. They formed a monastic tradition that offered worship and tithing to Jegel, the God of Scribes and Depositioner of the Passed (Or any Deity overlooking the passing of the living to the Dead). They pledged to keep track of all those denizens that once lived, how they lived, and when, how, where, and why they died. Over the decades they developed an advanced library and monastary, training their monks in the value of knowledge, gratitude, courage, and direct action.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Aspiring to be the Fountainhead of Clax, the High Duergar God of Pestilence and Destruction, Mammoon will stop at nothing to incarnate herself as the ultimate High Priestess; clad in the bones of a thousand dead, each bone tied to the next with the flesh of a thousand more.</p><p>Mammoon's aspirations come from her abuse at the hands of a former spouse. Married young and corralled into the traditional power positions of a Duergar wife, Mammoon sought power over everything else and would be ruthless in this pursuit. She sought the faith of her village, the surrounding region, and eventually the Underdark. Vying for a position as Loxxed Priestess, comparable to a magistrate, Mammoon watched as her competitor gained greater and greater favor. This favor grew as her competitor finally had a child. This Duergard tribe had a particularly hard time reproducing and this was a sign from their God. Not only did she face ongoing abuse from her husband about her barren womb, Mammoon now faced imminent defeat in her pursuit of power.</p><p>As the almost Spartan culture would allow, Mammoon snatched the child from its bed and brought it to the center idol of Clax, ringing the town bell. Many of her tribe flooded the streets to watch Mamoon sacrifice the child in offering to Clax. The statue reached down, scooped up the body, and consumed it violently. Mammoon was then imbued with an overwhelming sense that she was destined for greater things. She denounced the tribe in an animal growl and fled the Underdark in search of greater sacrifices to Clax. Seeing such violence in sacrifice has become her primary goal.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>In the town of Barrelheist [Seaside town or city] people are always astir because of the constant influx of supply and trade ships and the endless queue of traders and merchants hoping to be the first to acquire exotic goods. When the diaspora of hill Gnomes of Aznmott [Distant and Disappeared Gnomish City] were driven from their home by a string of massive experiments gone awry, they arrived to settle among the hills and valleys surrounding Barrelheist. These gnomes were instinctively drawn to the tradeport and quickly began to make up a large proportion of the population. Among this growing frontier shanty marketplace grew a remarkably talented gnome who shows great promise with steam technology, Kaz Lamosatzi.</p><p>Kaz' family was unorthodox in all possible ways. They rarely had a stable home and instead would simply have meeting spaces where they would reconvene after hard-working days of scavenging for materials to develop their steam inventions. What's more, the family unit was not traditional and instead consisted of non-hierarchical extended family and friends. Family structure is so diffuse among these Hill Gnomes that it's rare a member can identify a proper 'mother' or 'father'. Instead they are most drawn to whatever individual inspires invention!</p><p>Kaz cultivated his capacity for invention and steam technology and his gadgets gained popularity among the sailors and merchants of Barrelheist. Always chipper and looking for the good in things, Kaz successfully disguises a certain disdain for wealthy people that he acquired living much like an urchin in a shanty town frequented by the noble and affluent.

    background-story: |
      <p>The hillside Dusk Goblins of Akhlo-Meek [Any major Goblin Village] remain relatively peaceful and rarely disrupt humanoid settlements beyond the hills. They are however plagued by raids from Underdark Goblins that emerge from the surrounding caves. These raids pose a serious threat, particularly because they result in captives being taken and enslaved. The Mountain Goblins aretactical in so far as they specifically target youth with the intention of converting them to following the increasingly violent and hate-fueled Goblinoid Deity Kyhaergebaerg [Any aggressive Goblinoid God]. Yeet was raised in this environment, inculcated with hatred for humanoid races and a desire to spill their blood, ravage their townships, and steal their shiny things.</p><p>Yeet might have been captured at the right time for conversion and subjected to viscious and violent 'therapies', but he is still able to remember that he is a Dusk goblin. He's able to reflect on an upbringing that promoted brotherhood and stability. Nonetheless, he has still been infused with the hatred and bloodlust that characterizes Underdark Goblins. He is characterized by this dissonance.</p><p>Drawn into a raid of purportedly magical Dwarven caves by a tyrannical hobgoblin, Herkog, Yeet played a lieutenant role in controlling the captured Dwarves and staving off any intruders. Yet the mission went amiss when a group of adventurers from the nearby frontier town of Rheidolen [Any small frontier town] were comissioned to clear the caves and interrogate Herkog about his connections to the violent raids on surrounding towns. Herkog was slain and the goblin population eliminated. Except for Yeet. Because Herkog was slain before he could be questioned, this party of adventurers questioned Yeet instead. Yeet broke down and told them of how he is a Dusk Goblin and should never have been involved in this affair. He begged or his life and gave the adventuring party more than enough information to continue on with achieving their objectives. He was escorted back to Rheidolen for questioning and a potential trial but, because of the lack of security and organization in this frontier town, it was easy for such a crafty Goblin to escape. He now roams the wilderness and distant towns seeking other dusk Goblins.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>When the village of Everskinnis was raided by Ogres and goblinoids, the inevitable results of the plunder and pillage was that the ravaged female escapees would birth half-breeds. Relima Haas, a young woman and former wife of a fine hunter who fell in the raids, was among these poor women. The gestation period was more than draining and the birth fatal. Scarback was born.</p><p>Scavenging for food and other sustenance and forced to reform their beliefs and direction, the camp of survivors raised Scarback in the wilderness. He learned to value the spirits of the wild beasts and flora. He also learned the value of connecting with the rage he felt over the abuses imparted upon his mother and her now scattered community of hunters.</p><p>A small portion of these survivors refused to live in survival-mode and instead departed together to seek a better life. Scarback followed. The 5 departees were the smarter and more talented of the group. One of these departees was a beautiful young elven woman named Bodius towards whom Scarback took a serious liking.</p><p>Traveling village to village, they would perform feats of strength and agility for coins to wrangle up food or drink. In time, they came to be known as an entertaining side-show. On one fateful night, the group encountered a particularly vicious pack of gnolls. Scarback fought valiantly while most of the group were slain. The gnolls plundered what they could and fled while Scarback was left tending to a seriously wounded Bodius with tears in his eyes.</p><p>"Scarback love pretty elf-lady", he lamented.</p><p>He tucked Bodius in the group's steamer chest and gently fed her, gave her water, and tended to her wounds as he made his way to the nearest township. Upon next opening the steamer, Bodius was somewhat recovered and attempted to get out.</p><p>"No. Elf lady not safe", Scarback proclaimed as he knocked her out with a back hand. He tied her up securely, stuffed cloth in her mouth, and closed the chest, determined to keep Bodius safe from harm. Yet, that same day, when he made his way through town his mind encountered a serious psychological schism; he couldn't accept what he'd done and immediately began searching for Bodius. At the same time he has an inexorable bond with his steamer trunk. Twice daily, in private, he will check on his belongings and only then recognize that Bodius remains in the chest. He will feed her and provide her water, only to Bind and gag her and lock the steamer back up.</p>

      <p>Eleanorious hails from a regal clan of golden Dragonborn who have integrated themselves well into the ruling population of the region. The Murr family, especially, have developed meaningful emotional and economic relationships within Xhontapys [Major Trade City] and positioned themselves well as purveyors of finer goods within its trade nexus.</p><p>With a knack for measuring volumes by eye and comprehending chemical reactions prior to mixing ingredients, Eleanorious trained with various local phylacteries and alchemists to learn this remarkable trade. She has become well-known for her expertise as well as her pleasant personality, fine work-ethic, and her good fashion sense.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Wandering through the woods, Cal Manterius realized that he had no idea where he was or where he was going. The brain fog imposed by that Green Hag who was haunting his village lingered. Was there a hag? What village? Cal's mind tumbled through what he thought were memories but wouldn't stop tumbling. He was getting dizzy. Stop tumbling! He cried out in his mind.</p><p>He stumbled into a clearing in the woods where ruined buildings from a long razed village jutted out of the landscape like giant skeletal fingers reaching for the freedom of the sky. Is this where I was headed? Cal looked about. Seemed like a place that one might look for. He set up a makeshift camp, chewed down some jerky and tack, and grabbed himself a nice sleep.</p><p>Upon waking, Cal's mind filled with wonder and glee that he had found what he had been searching for. This is it! But why was I searching for this place? Cal searched the area further only to find burnt Firbolg bones and burnt equipment. They did it again! They silenced us. We mustn't allow this! He thought to himself. His mind turned inward upon itself. All his memories of living and growing up in a regal Firbolg village became muddled together with his recent explorations. He couldn't discern the difference and instead concluded that he must be the last of his royal line that some mysterious force seeks to end.</p><p>No. I cannot allow it. I must find our sacred land. Our true Kingdom. The only way is to connect with those who claim royal positions here in this region and beyond. I must rebuild our people. Crazy Cal made his was through the tangled forests to the nearest town and began his meager political campaign to recharge his royal line. Although he is not consciously aware of his Firbolg clan's monastic heritage, his muscle memory and reflexive training are embedded within him. A contradiction, this Firbolg monk is loud and brazen.</p>

      <p>The Ter family have been free of the Underdark for generations. Having integrated themselves well within the community of the Town/City of Allaris [Any minor or major Town or City with decent traffic], they have found an abundant life as traders, innkeepers, barkeeps, and the like. Giza remains close with her family and, because of their adaptation of dislocation into comfortable living, she promotes the values of hearth and home as a mindset, rather than a bloodline or geographical location.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The Goliaths of Gond'Qor are known as devout followers of Re, the God of Hooves and Horns [Any Central Goliath Deity]. These religious peoples promote strength and fortitude in their followers and advocate for supporting the strengths and good in others. Raised in this complex ritualistic community, Irtano developed a strong set of powers, abilities, and skills, and an even stronger set of ethics about how to treat himself and others. This also imbued him with high expectations as to how others ought to treat him.</p><p>The Order of Re have set missionary goals whereby they send accomplished acolytes out into the Realms to aid in building up the 'lesser-thans' and promote their code of interconnected support. Irtano was selected as one such acolyte and sent forth to display his strength and abilities and to promote the Order's code of a Realm-wide brotherhood of strength and support.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>The Halflings of Yeilumph [Any Small Halfling Town] are known for their high quality of life and especially their indulgences. This community loves to develop the finest of all things pleasurable, from candies to sexual events, from the most exotic crossbred fruit to the jams made from those fruit to use as fillings in a wondrous danish. The population of Yeilumph hold the belief that these indulgences are the answer to life's troubles.</p><p>Enter Cruda. A young halfing woman who loved a good slice of Sylvan Nut Bread with Apple butter for breakfast every morning, followed by a tart Flumberry Danish and a good swig of Pine Brew Cider to wash it all down. Her love for pastries and breads meant that she spent most of her time at the local bakery interacting with the baker and all of her staff. Slowly but surely, Gruda learned the trade. Along the way she also uncovered new methods of growing grains to produce different colors and textures. The innovation was so spectacular for the shop and the trade in general that the people nicknamed her, "Wheatsheaf".</p><p>Gruda longed to spread the joy of baked goods to the rest of the realm. She took the coin she earned for her innovation and purchased a small home in the nearby city of PinionMast [Any major trade City]. She gleefully carted her supplies and goods to the markets of PinionMast. Upon arriving in town to offer her fine baked goods it seemed there was little to no competition. Gruda had a corner on the tastiest baked goods around. She longs to open her very own shop one day.</p>

    introduction: Khedoldosh maintains a tent/hut at the outskirts of a market or tavern district with a sign above the entrance that glows with faint magical energy and reads, "TELLINGS".

    background-story: |
      <p>In the battle of Granite Water [any great historical battle in recent time], an old orcish warlock, Gryt Tooth of Mahl, was faced with certain death at the hands of an incoming legion of the Elves of ThistleCloud [Any Major Elven City]. He turned to his last resort: an old summoning scroll that was tattered. In desperation facing the encroaching legion, the warlock uttered as many words as he could read from the scroll and performed whatever gestures he could make out to cast the spell. Flashes of light and shadow burst from nowhere, colliding in mid air in a cloud of grainy black mist that congealed into the form of a beholder. However, the scroll had been damaged badly and the verbal and somatic components thus distorted. The unfortunate result was an undeveloped creature, Khedoldosh, who glanced around with its only working eye, realized the imminent danger, and darted off into the hills. Needless to say, Gryt Tooth didn't live much longer.</p>

      <p>After years in the city of Hula-krah [Any sky city in the Plane of Air] as a Peacekeeper and high-ranking military official, overlooking the material planes in all their woes, Aeureek decided it was the duty of his people to bring justice to the ground. He conferred with officals and family about his decision and they were all in agreeance; it was time for the people of the sky to bring the freedom of true justice to the greedy land-dwellers. Aeureek and numerous other worthy and authorized members of the community were sent on their way to aid the ground-dwellers.</p><p>Aeureek settled into the crime-ridden town of Helmsloft [Any major city that could suffer from heavy crime] and confidently approached the town's magistrates. He provided a convincing speech as to how the city required changes to their policing and corrections training and the corresponding structures. With his regal appearance and voice supporting a well-thought out and honest speech, which included numerous accurate observations Aeureek had gathered from his observations in the clouds, the magistrates were convinced to make such changes. Aeureek was offered a position among the magistrates but firmly declined, asserting that his abilities would best suit a position among the officers and within the confines of the slums and markets. Since then, Aeureek has been a well-respected and often feared officer and an advisor to the magistrates.</p>

    introduction: Chloe is that 'bored-looking-guard'. She will specifically make contact with adventurers who are passing through that look like they are willing and capable to stir the pot and cause a bit of 'no no' amongst the population.

    #
    appearance:   Rather plain jane appearance - couldn't be picked out of a crowd; Wearing the armor of the local militia acting as watchmen for the city/town; In off hours, Chloe wears bland dresses and tops but pays close attention to her hair and shoes as though compensating for her rather average appearance

    expressions:  "Can't make wine outta olives - some call me an olive, but I know I'm a cherry!"; "Keeping the peace seems foolhardy when its the Kings and Queens that cause the conflicts in the first place"; "I say 'Stick it to em', gold-hungry scoundrels, they are";

    #
    # Mannerisms: what does the character do with their hands?  And eyes, mouth, etc.

    #
    mannerisms:   Timid at first glance but courageous in spirit, Chloe will often avoid engaging with others; Order/task oriented - goes from standing still to pointing and gesturing to the next task at hand; Most often found reading through her list of ingredients for her wines and her methods of making them; Sometimes throws a wrench in the gears of watchkeeping

    background-story: |
      <p>Born and bred in the middle class market district of the city of Johseveille [Any major city], Chloe gained both a taste for and disdain for bourgeios comforts. Both of her parents were political advisors and urged Chloe into the same vocation but Chloe was rebellious in her youth, causing all kinds of trouble with local merchants and incoming adventurers. She was particularly notorious for getting so drunk on cherry or apple wine that her teeth would turn colors. One night she broke into a locel wine-maker's facility and stole a small barrel of wine and decanting equipment. Her parents quickly grew tired of this behavior and enrolled her in the local militia.</p><p>Needless to say, Chloe's dichotomous attitude continued into her years of training with the militia. She enjoyed the challenge and growth but despised the regimen and boundaries. As a coping mechanism to bring more joy to her life, Chloe turned back to wine. She's been charged with dereliction of duty on numerous occasions. However, since her parents are high-ranking political advisors she has protection against any kind of discharge from her duties. Consequently, she floats through her duties during the day and returns to her passion for wine-making at night. She has a small tent outside of her family home within which she practices methods of decanting late into the twilight hours.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>A beautiful pig can be someone's pride and joy. The smoothness and pink hues of its skin worthy of admiration from fellow livestockers. Fot learned this early in his years as his family of Hill Goblins toiled away at producing and grooming the finest pigs anyone had seen. Perhaps they worked with such fervor because they sought to clear the dirt off the name 'Goblin'. Perhaps they toiled so hard because they just loved pigs that much. Who knows? Doesn't matter to Fot. All that matters to Fot is that the pigs are healthy, smooth, and with that perfect shade of pink that makes you kiss your fingers and say, "muah".</p><p> Pigs weren't their only trophies. Fot's family also produce what they believe to be the finest Folla Tubers and Gum Beans in the region, among other vegetables. With a staunch work ethic and a kind and respectful attitude uncommon from Goblins directed towards the merchants and traders of the nearby villages and cities, Fot and his family have established a stable standard of living. But not without further hard work. Little Fot continues his daily 16 hour grind to and from trading centers and market squares as a purveyor of fine livestock and farmed goods. He is also a committed competitor in the bi-annual pig competition, "Cochonatico", and has numerous ribbons and trophies to show-off.</[>

    background-story: |
      <p>Brushing his dreadlocks from his eyes, Albrecht stares down the elves approaching his work site. "Oy, git yer dirty feet off this site! Yer gonna taint the beauty of my work!" He snarls, spitting in their direction. The two elves remark to each other about the rarity they see nailing shingles to the roof of the new tavern. A half-orc? A feral dwarf? They cannot be certain. His muscular body and scars tell a story of a man who is not civilized, per se. A man who would unleash rage upon them. The elves depart.</p><p>The progeny of a Dwarven slave woman who answered to Orcish slavers in a barbaric tribe, Albrecht had no true connection to family, as one might know it, except to hate others and unleash rage upon those who challenge him.</p><p> Tired of the poor and sloppy indulgences of his tribe, Albrecht sought greater wealth and power. He followed a trading caravan he saw passing in the distance of the plains, offering to help them with any repairs or services they might need. He continued on with this 'hired-hand' type business upon arriving in the town of Meership Downs, a small sailing port and bustling sea-side community. Here he grew his talents, but also his hatred for other races as the village was frequented by many types of people carousing, drinking, fighting, and all-around ne'er-do-wells. Now, Albrecht focuses on having his 'stamp' on as many buildings, ships, wagons, and so forth, as he possibly can. He puts his anger and hatred into his work knowing that unleashing his rage would not only be dangerous for others, but most certainly for himself.</p>

      <p>In a moody drawl, Teaghan lists off the provisions ordered by the head of the local militia. Their defense of Synon-Dor [Any major city] requires that each and every militia member is well-fed and Teaghan is aware of this and her important role in the defense of the city. She is, after all, the primary provisioner for the militia.</p><p>Raised in the farmlands surrounding the city that were provisioned by Baron Korimir Havensloch upon the inception of his oligarchical rule, Teaghan spent her early years as a farmhand on the farmlands of her immediate and extended family. /p><p>When the threat of encroaching waves of Hobgoblins and Orcs threatened the security of the city, the militia required more streamlined channels for sundries and provisions.

    background-story: |
      <p>Always the ham of his large family, Eldaren had an innate talent to entertain others, whether that be through song, dance, or comedy. It simply came natural. His family were very supportive of this talent and young Eldaren quickly became a popular feature in his village performing in full-on stage productions, strumming a lute in the local tavern, or all-dressed-up in his famously ridiculous clowning garb and performing long mime sequences in the village square.</p><p>His name eventually became known among other connected towns and cities. Eldaren's talents were requested by playwrights and tavern keepers throughout the region. He soon became a recognizable celebrity with passers-by remarking, "I saw your performance of Gonidorin in 'the Leaves will Fall as they May!" or something equally astounded. Only the erudite recognize that many of his performances have a hidden message promoting freeding the commoners from the clutches of the royalty.</p>

      <p>Kraven is not infected. He is what one would call a 'true' weretiger born of the breed in the jungles of Khuile [Any isolated vilage of Weretigers]. Set upon a collection of river mouths draining into the sea, he and his brood were also skilled sea-men. His clan claim to be descendents of the original weretigers and remain staunchly noble in their dealings with others with the hopes of changing public opinion towards lycanthropes.</p><p>Kraven set forth on such an information campaign but was met with rebukes and violence. His lycanthropic form was incredibly dangerous in defence of many violent altercations, many of which unfortunately resulted in murders.</p><p>Kraven thus turned his hand to what was in his heart: sailing, artwork, shadows, magic, mystery, and music. Combining these passions, Kraven is one of the first and only tattoo artists in the region who can offer magic tattoos - at a costly price.</p>

    introduction: This sketchy old elf is something of a myth more than a man. He remains well out of sight of guards and militia yet regularly has secret dealings with the middle to upper eschelons of local political factions. If adventurers passing through town appear to have valuable items or be capable of acquiring such items, he will contact them through secret letters via an innkeeper or bartender and arrange a meeting in a private place. He may also commission a particularly remarkable group to find certain valuable items.

      The "Pennymore Con" is in search of a magic stone with sigils carved into it. It passed through his fencing shop and in the process captured an aspect of his soul. He doesn't know what it does but he knows it will bring him riches at the expense of others so he never says anything, but instead dreams of it night and day.

    background-story: |
      <p>As is well known across the Realms, Elves live a very long time. During these extensive life-spans, they are susceptible to major life changes, whether in vocation, direction, location, or what-have-you. Nobody knows where the Con hails from, they only know that he is a Sylvan Elf because of his gaunt, lanky, and gruff appearance, ruddy skin and hair, and his bright silverish eyes. Nobody is sure what life trajectory brought the Pennymore Con to where he is today. The few things that are known about him could be myth.</p><p>The Con is blamed across the Realm for various high-level robberies and for starting various skirmishes between nations by offering a contract on an important local Duke in exchange for a long-sought after item that had been fenced to him. Constantly seeking business with members of every eschelon of a city or town, the Con is open about his business dealings but opaque as to his motivations. Consequently, although suspected of high crimes, none have been proven and the Con is allowed free movement. In fact, his movement is likely advocated among higher magistrates because of the goods and services they've obtained from him through less-than-legal means.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>A largely forgotten child of a wealthy Dragonborn family nearly obliterated by discriminating Elven and Human armies, Captain Wheeler became something of a man-whore chasing females for personal validation. In these seedy social circles, he connected with the Violet Conch, a high-sea slaver group who traded in peoples of any race or social class so long as it was profitable. Realizing his opportunity at wealth (and not caring that others would suffer) Captain Wheeler trained with the Violet Conch, learning the 'ropes' of sailing and trading peoples as goods. The process largely wore down his moral compass.</p><p>Regardless of these heavy experiences, Wheeler (renamed by his sailmates - his original name only known to him at this point) is well known as the 'beast who inspires' or the 'spirit of the wandering sailor' because of his profound fecundity with respect to sea-shanties. Those shanties have become even more renown because of their magical effects - often saving sailors and their ships in crisis.</p>

    appearance:   Paralysed on her left side, Moss walks by lifting one graceful, strong leg, then stamping and clobbering the floor with her rigid half.  Her face is half frown, lips curled down, and half expressive.  White stripes streak her roiling black curled hair.

    background-story: |
      <p>Whispering to an Amyrillis that "the current war will end soon", a young Moss heard a quiet voice in her head.</p><p>You have the gift, child.</p><p>Moss was suddenly struck with a channel of supernatural energy from beyond. Her mind was filled with visions of nature while her body was struck with unfortunate disabilities. At this point, when the Goddess of Blooms, without location but existing within every seed and petal, touched her, Moss became aware that she was destined for more than a life arranging flowers for others.</p><p>Moss' real name is lost in time. Raised in a testosterone fueled environment with 3 brothers and a long-passed mother, Moss was beleaguered with pseudo-abuse directed towards her womanhood. She absorbed these in her youth, thinking it was normal, but after being touched by the Goddess of Blooms she realized the horrors of which men are capable. In this moment another insight was whispered directly into the center of her mind.</p><p>Men are but the seeds. Save the soils, milady. Bless the petals. Love the stems. Revere the roots. But we will always be able to produce more seeds.</p>

      <p>Nobody can be sure how Scheuschzeri ended up in the ponds. But everyone kows that he hears the best of the news because he's always treading water in a well-placed pond. Scheuschzeri will spend most of his time in deeper waters by the wharf in the sea-side frontier village of Griptight Keep [Any Seaside Trading Village] overlorded by the pirate baron Koon The Bold. He spends daytime hours skipping out of the wharf into the various marshy puddles that characterize the paths of the village overhearing conversations. He's become so attuned to these interactions and the value of their content to others that he often positions himself in the best spots to overhear the best possible informations.</p><p>How did poor Scheuschzeri become this this way? Nobody is completely certain. Some claim that he was once a pirate who had fallen in love with a Siren while at sea and upon his attempt to capture her heart she laughed in his face and banished him to the ponds and wharf-side. Others tell a story of how it was his own choice; that he is actually a powerful sorcerer who grew tired of his capabilities and cast this polymorph on himself in reverence of the greater society.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Princess Ateh may or may not be a princess anymore. The Khazar kingdom [A halfling kingdom that has been lost (or maybe not!)] did not fair well in the Goblin and Hobgoblin raids of the Dark Reckoning of Rakosh Ghaal [Any Goblinoid or Orcish Deity]. Largely razed to the ground, the Khazar kingdom was once a bright kingdom populated by loving and generous halfings and their ilk. Ateh was among their best. Having been driven from her kingdom by war and subsequently hunted by the vicious dark forces of Rokash Ghaal, Ateh now remains in hiding yet continues her well-skilled political performances for various factions within the realms to promote equality and abundance.</p><p>Her people believed in the beauty imparted by by Ku, her people's concept of a central spiritual entity. The philosophy of Ku dictates that all things happen at the same time and that time is merely the gift of enjoying every moment that has existed or will exist. Her beliefs fuel her beauty and her beauty fuels her beliefs.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>When someone needs something dirty done, something that will inspire ire in the minds of the local guard or militia, one does not turn to a friend or even an acquaintance unless they wish trouble to descend upon their home or business. Instead, one turns to a paid person, a person who they may only know through stories at the tavern or from the songs of a bard. Samuel Cohen comes up in both story and song. His dreams ring of each story and lyric. A haunting or a gift? Not even Samuel can tell.</p><p>Samuel is an orphan. He hasn't received word from the clergy as to who his parents were or the circumstances through which he was dropped off. One thing he does know is that he doesn't really care. Family is for the blind. His youth in the orphanage in a small town was as expected: violent and traumatizing. He learned quickly the value of exchanging things or coins for safety or services. What's more, and what he may not have even consciously learned, per se, was from the conditioning imposed upon him by the clergy of Khalal [A separatist sect turned sour], a deity of scarcity largely followed by the marginalized and desperate. These priestesses and nuns would subject the children to questionable behavior modification experiments in their sleep. Their goal was to remove the resentment and contempt from the desperate and replace it with gratitude and hope. Little did they know, they had created entire worlds in the minds of their guinea pigs.</p><p>Upon release from the clergy during his adolescence, Samual vowed to care about only one thing: how he could advance himself in the waking world.</p>

      <p>The Drow are a largely rejected race in the Realms. Numeorus tribes have departed from traditional ways in hopes of achieving peace for themselves and between themselves and the denizens of the Upper World. The clans of Dire Dawa [Any Underdark Village] seek such noble ends. A self-appointed council of diplomats in this village have made it their goal to spread the word that the people of the Underdark are best set to survive and flourish with the cooperation of the other races of the Realms. </p><p>Since most magic is under strict control within most of the Underdark and thus messages and missives are difficult to convey, the peoples of Dire Dawa needed to rely on actual footwork to pass messages between and across the peoples of the Underdark who sought to escape the control of the few dark deities who had gained the majority of control in the regions. They relied on 'runners' to bring messages back and forth. Abrinet was chosen as one of the few to plat this revered position.</p><p>Although not the fittest or most able, it was her commitment to absolving the Underdark of its ills that convinced her town council to appoint her as a 'runner'. She has yet to let them down, except for her more than occasional travels to the Upperworld.</p>

      <p>There really aren't any swamp Gnomes. Except for Yasloh. Emerging from a mountain cave on a dimly glimmering morning, the Gnome sputtered at the sun, "Yes, yes, I know that already", and coughed up a bit of flem in his hand. He slapped his hands together and rubbed them vigorously, laughing to himself. "What does this day have to offer?" He stepped forward out of the cave and his foot found no ground. The black swamps of Kol-oug had deceived yet another. Whoever Yasloh used to be was absorbed into the gritty sandy mire of Kol-oug. How could I have forgotten the bloody swamp? Was the last thought that crossed his mind before the Mind Flayer pit swamp consumed his identity.</p><p>Three days later a small humanoid limped his way towards a makeshift Halfling military camp. "Who goes there?", cried the lieutenant. The "Brain" began to reflect upon itself and found nothing. Well, who does go here? He asked himself. Nothing. "Who goes there?" The lieutenant asked again. Oh, well, I had better answer him. He seems important. "Brain!" Yasloh shouted the only thing he could think. "Brain" approached the militia party having all the smarts he had before but having no idea who he actually was. "Oy, innit a gnome...", the halfling lieutenant remarked, "covered in muck". "Yes", Yasloh replied, "a swamp gnome". "But there's no such..." Yasloh shot the soldier an intimidating glance. Silence. They gave "Brain" a place to clean up and change. </p><p>During this reflection time his mind filled with criss-crossing images of shimmering grids and incoherent numbers and languages. These hallucinations eventually began to congeal into gears, sigils, machinations, glyphs, and locations of great power. It appeared as though Yasloh had fallen asleep in the bath at the camp and he began muttering incomprehensibly in an increasing volume until he was nearly shouting. A young Halfling soldier approached to shake him awake. "Sir. Sir? Are you okay? Are you..." And Yasloh shot up in the bathtub screaming valorously, "I've got it mate!" He may have lost his past but now saw the many magical inventions that would define his future.</p>

    background-story: |
      <p>Needless to say, Orcs aren't known for their navy. Yet that isn't to say that Orcs aren't sea-savvy. Born and raised by the Yellow Teeth tribe in the Northern Wastes of Kalauzumar [Any Remote Wasteland], Nagata was taught in swamp navigation and eventually in how to navigate the more shallow seas that surrounded the Wastelands. An ambitious youth, they dreamed of a life on the seas. But they knew this wouldn't be possible within the confines of their tribe. Although they tried their hands at engineering various war machines for their tribe and were actually quite talented at it, this couldn't possibly compare to their dreams of living a life on the high-seas. </p><p>Although they loved their people, they loved the sea more. After yet another unecessarily violent raid by their tribe on a sea-side frontier town they all made their way back towards the black swamps they deemed their home. Nagata was dismayed. They took a quick look around at the crew, made a broad and clearly unsuspicious gesture towards the starboard bow of the ship and whistled clearly (a known call for their shipmates) and then made a deliberate and unnoticeable dash to the port side of the ship diving off quietly into the water.</p><p>Nagata swam to shore unnoticed and sat on their knees. They ran their fingers through the sand, muttering, "dear sea, you have me".</p>

      Reina was cursed as a young child, possibly for something her outlander parents did. She was given the Curse of the Forgotten which allows only characters with high perception (16) to even see her and only characters with exceptional perception (19+) to remember she exists if they arenäó»t directly looking at her. This has left Reina to raise and fend for herself from a young age. </p><p>She longs for friends and connection while doing what she needs to to survive. She longs to return to the barbarian clan that forgot her as a child but lives on city streets as a pick pocket and thief. </p><p>What Reina doesnäó»t know about herself is a very dangerous secret for everyone.... Reina is The Wraith! Her curse is actually a spell put on her a spymaster of the assassins guild at the same time that he murdered her tribe and created her split personality. When her skills are needed a simple subliminal phrase brings out the Wraith, the realms deadliest assassin, and Reina never remembers a thing.</p>

      He grew up in a Triton city and lived there until his early teens, when he accompanied a team to dry land for the first time, where he saw a firestorm and while the other Tritons avoided it, he felt irresistibly drawn to it and has loved fire since. </p><p>However, he once accidentally burned a valuable book while playing with the fire and is constantly looking for ways to feed his pyromaniac self while not burning any books and avoiding the natural uncomfortable feeling that most Tritons have around fire.

    background-story: |
      The 2nd born son of a local baron, Draake could never stay still. </p><p>As a young boy, he was formally trained as a knight. He and his brother Trassel were inseperable, but Draake knew he would never rule and he hated the pomp of court life. </p><p>At 16 he left the castle in the night looking for adventure. He found it in a tavern where he met Taron. The two teenagers quickly became friends. Leaving his hometown of Oxlight behind him, the two adventured far and wide, both starting and ending many fights along the way. During this time, the charismatic Draake convinced more adventurers to join their ranks. </p><p>At 24, Draake was captured on a raid and brought back to town. His brother, now Lord, almost didn't recognize him. Granted clemency, the two agreed to enrich each other. </p><p>Trassel ensured that Draake would become the local bandit leader by sending his soldiers against all other gangs and in return Trassel recieved a cut from every raid. Draake would keep the gang in line and would take new recruits (criminals from Oxlight) which helped lower expenses for Trassel and made him look better to the king. This arrangement has persisted for the last 26 years.

      They, like the others of their kind, were born whole-cloth from the Aether. They were trained as a thief and assassin for the previous crime lord and did his bidding until the day They were supposed to die. But Gothenni didn't want to die. Their will to live proved stronger than the nature of Their being and in Their final moment They absorbed the total life essence of their employer, extending Their life and ending his. From that point on, They took over as the new boss and continued to feed their Vampiric Hunger with anyone who crossed Them

      Varun is one of very few who know that the Bakerfield family is now run by a Lich who lives across the continent using the family's resources to further his quest to become a god. Varun also knows where all of the bodies are buried (metaphorically because he has his finger on the pulse of the city, and literally because he put a lot of the bodies there.)

    - Varun's great club
    - "Widowmaker" is never far from his grasp. It was imbued with a strong magic that makes it easier and faster to wield by the Lich whom he secretly serves. Mechanically
    - it is a +3 magic weapon. Varun has had this club since he was a teenager
    - living on the streets of Underboot [or any slum in the major city who's criminal underworld he now runs]. He could barely wield it then

    background-story: |
      You simply don't want to commit a crime in Invasaad without VarunBakerfield's blessing as his thieve's guild - the Bakerfield Family has a vice-like grip on the city's criminal underworld. </p><p>Varun Bakerfield developed his dog-eat-dog attitude growing up on the streets of Underboot [or another slum in a major city] in the shadows of the cosmopolitan city of Invasaad [or another major, advanced city.] To this day, he despises those born with a silver spoon in their mouths and the culture that they enjoy. </p><p>Supremely confident, he believes that what he lacks in book learning, he more than makes up for in raw intellect and street-smarts. Furthermore, he knows that if he canäó»t win an argument with words, he can settle one with his fists, or his club "Widowmaker" just as easily.</p><p>As a natural leader, people have always naturally been drawn to him. It is this natural charisma combined with utter ruthlessness that allowed Varun to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld until he was ready to start his own guild. </p><p>From there, he waged a war on the other guilds, winning turf wars with violence and cunning until he and his guild were the only street level gang standing.</p><p>During his rise, to help assure victory, Varun made a deal with a Lich named Ryxiltan. In exchange for a large portion of his guild's earnings, Ryxiltan used his magic to permanently increase Varun's strength and leadership presence going as far as giving him the ability to bend weak-minded criminals to his will whenever he pleased while also giving him the gift of extended life.The fact that he looks to be 40 years old despite being nearly 100 is the only visible vlue of the Lich's magic.</p><p>Being the servant of a powerful Lich is no easy task. Despite his success, Varun regrets the deal he made and is looking for ways to get himself out of it.

      In her youth she was like the rest of her crop, she spent all of her time training for The Trials. One day while training in the Library of Kefnet, somebody left out an old ancient tome for her to discover that revealed pieces of the true history of Amonkhet [or any country within your campaign setting].  Since then she has devoted her life to researching and uncovering the real history of her world while hiding her search from her superiors

      Noel starts as a Ranger. When the DM reveals more information about Noel's past through the story, Noel is able to reflect those changes on their character sheet: Meaning that if in Noel's past, the DM reveals they were a thief, Noel could obtain proficiency in thief's tools, or even multiclass as a rogue. This special ability can happen at anytime and is not related to experience, but is up to the DM.
      |
      There are some downsides to having amnesia. When Noel finds out about their past, if events go against their current alignment, Noel would make a wisdom saving throw (DC 10). If they fail, they take 1d4 physic damage and that damage is removed from their max HP.

    background-story: |
      Noel was not always a warforged. They remember the grass upon their feet and the taste of mead, but nothing else, not even their name. </p><p>The name Noel comes from an old manufacturing plate located on the body they woke up in: Number 31 (No.31). The body was long ago discarded. </p><p>Noel awoke in a mass grave of warforged with only a name in their head. The are not sure if the name is theirs or if it is someone they once knew. They have been searching for answers to no prevail. </p><p>They have been kicked out of towns and shunned from inns for the way they look. They have only ever found sanctuary in temples and alone in the woods.  They have resorted to requesting local clerics to ask around about the faceless name for any answers. </p><p>The true backstory of this character is up to the DM. Is this character somehow connected to your party or the BBEG? </p><p>were they in a romantic partnership with a necromancer or Lich and when they died, their partner did everything they could to bring them back? Were they a warlock that made a deal with their patron? After they died did the patron put their soul into a machine for them to continue to serve? Are those memories actually their own, or are they being manipulated? </p><p>There are so many possibilities, that I wouldn't feel right cementing only one background for this character. Adjust as needed for your own campaign.

    background-story: |
      Andrel grew up in a reclusive tribe of Ghostwise and was trained early as a hunter and scout. Unlike a lot of her tribe, she was seized by the wanderlust that afflicts many Halflings, she left the deeps woods and ventured out into society to make her name. Her reputation as a hunter and guide precedes her and is widely regarded as one of the best people to help travelers find their way safely through any section of woodland.  Over the years she has also developed a strong distaste for orcs and their regular attempts to ambush travelers.
