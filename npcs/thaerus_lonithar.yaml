# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Thaerus is a water Genasi and, like most Genasi, she sometimes struggles to fit in to a society where she rarely sees another living being that looks like her. Unlike most Genasi, she was not abandoned by her Djinn parent
     (in her case, her father Cryxistmalin). Instead, she was abandoned by her half-elf mother on the steps of a monastery several days travel from the home where she was born. Growing up in the monastery, Thaerus excelled
     in her monastic training and grew ever more proficient in the art of fighting with her preferred weapon, the spear. Cryxistmalin would occasionally visit Thaerus secretly as a child and tell her stories of a long lost
     village by the sea that was settled by the Genasi children of a handful of water Djinn who somehow found each other in the world. Thaerus believed this story to be entirely fiction through her childhood and adolescent
     years, and would likely still believe so today if she hadn't witnessed her father's murder; a punishment for revealing this secret to her administered by another, more powerful Djinn. Cryxistmalin used his last dying breaths
     to hide Thaerus from the eyes of Djinns who would wish to see this secret die along with him, imbuing her weapons with elemental magic, and providing her with a large sum of wealth. Today, Thaerus is obsessed with finding
     this lost city, learning why it's existence is such a strongly protected secret and avenging her father. She has invested her inheritance from her father in the development of an archeological exploration company that she
     uses to track down this settlement and unearth other secrets of the realm's past along the way.

    personality: |
     Thaerus is an intelligent and competent woman, she runs a successful archeology and treasure hunting business. Her kind are generally disliked and distrusted by the rest of society, but she has managed to make a good name
     for herself around town. She is driven and intense, but also very inquisitive and patient when it comes to solving puzzles and looking for clues. She desperately wants to solve the puzzle that is the hidden city, find its
     answers and exact her revenge
