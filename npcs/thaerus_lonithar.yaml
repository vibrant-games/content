    background-story: |
      <p>Thaerus is a water Genasi and, like most Genasi, she sometimes struggles to fit in to a society where she rarely sees another living being that looks like her. Unlike most Genasi, she was not abandoned by her Djinn parent (in her case, her father Cryxistmalin). Instead, she was abandoned by her half-elf mother on the steps of a monastery several days travel from the home where she was born.</p><p>Growing up in the monastery, Thaerus excelled in her monastic training and grew ever more proficient in the art of fighting with her preferred weapon, the spear. Cryxistmalin would occasionally visit Thaerus secretly as a child and tell her stories of a long lost village by the sea that was settled by the Genasi children of a handful of water Djinn who somehow found each other in the world. </p><p>Thaerus believed this story to be entirely fiction through her childhood and adolescent years, and would likely still believe so today if she hadn't witnessed her father's murder; a punishment for revealing this secret to her administered by another, more powerful Djinn. Cryxistmalin used his last dying breaths to hide Thaerus from the eyes of Djinns who would see to have this secret die along with imbuing her weapons with elemental magic and providing her with a large sum of wealth.</p><p>Today, Thaerus is obsessed with finding this lost city, learning why it's existence is such a strongly protected secret and avenging her father. She has invested her inheritance from her father in the development of an archeological exploration company that she uses to track down this settlement and unearth other secrets of the realm's past along the way.</p>
