# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you

    - content: Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet
    - content: An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered
    - content: Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
    - content: Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)
    - content: Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases
               to function.
    - title: Shapechanger
    - content: You add the Polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast 
               whose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast Polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot
    - title: Master Transmuter
    - content: You can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's 
               stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
    - content: Major Transformation - You can transmute one nonmagical object – no larger than a 5-foot cube – into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 
                                      10 minutes handling the object to transform it.
    - content: Panacea - You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
    - content: Restore Life - You cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.
    - content: Restore Youth - You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.

    background-story: |
      Ulther Hapwath was originally a human but has spent most of their adult life experimaneting on and augmenting his own body in search of some distorted view of human perfection. A skilled spell slinger and hunter, 
      they hunt and capture many specimens of various creatures to study and experiment on. They are a brilliant biologist with an exceptional knowledge of many different creatures anatomy and the steady hands of a 
      surgeon. Recruited by Gerhardt Klippstein to join the Collegium for their vast biological knowledge, their employers are slightly less than keen on the reckless abandon with which they are willing to experiment 
      on themselves. Since they joined the Collegium, they have been contacted by a mysterious benefactor from beyond the veil. Ulther has no idea who this benefactor is, but they have been helping to guild their 
      self-evolution and in the creation of a substance called Cytoplast, a sort of ooze that helps with the bonding of upgrades and grants temporary healing when applied to a living creature.  Ulther's benefactor is 
      in fact, the disembodied spirit Momir Vig, disgraced and deceased former Guildmaster of the Simic Combine on the Plane of Ravnica. Somehow Momir has crossed into this world and is slowly using Ulther to create 
      Cytoplast and use it to build him a new body.

    #
    personality: |
      Ulther Hapwath is tall and muscular and severe-looking with pale blue skin and long. hip length, silver/white hair. They wears dark glasses as their replaced eyes are somewhat sensative to bright lights, and a 
      long, black leather trenchcoat that cover most of their bodily features. On closer inspection, its clear that Ulther has made significant modification to their body. Barbed skin on their hands and feet like a 
      spider for climbing, the wings of a manta for gliding, sections of crab-like shell armoring portions of their body and a segmented scorpions tail with stinger are all faintly noticeable if someone spends enough 
      time looking at them, although they are often using some kind of glamour (disguise self, polymorph, etc.) when in public so as not to stand out as much. Ulther is fanatical about his work and about chasing his 
      personal concept of bodily perfection and finds it hard to comprehend why everyone isn't seeking to augment thier bodies. They are reckless and never think twice about experimenting on themselves and have little 
      regard for the wellbeing of the other creatures that they experiment on. Thanks to the influence of their secret benefactor, they have gradually started to explore the commonly unknown arcane study of biomancy. 
      While mostly keeping this information to themselves, they have shared some of their studies with their close friend and fellow body-modifying scientist and Collegium member Thadeus Periwinkle. Thadeus and Ulther 
      are also the only two members of the Collegium who are still in contact with their estranged colleague, Dr. Andreas Stormhollow.
