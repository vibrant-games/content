    background-story: |
      They, like the others of their kind, were born whole-cloth from the Aether. They were trained as a thief and assassin for the previous crime lord and did his bidding until the day They were supposed to die. But Gothenni didn't want to die. Their will to live proved stronger than the nature of Their being and in Their final moment They absorbed the total life essence of their employer, extending Their life and ending his. From that point on, They took over as the new boss and continued to feed their Vampiric Hunger with anyone who crossed Them
