# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

                  dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep

                              are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to 
                              Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking Actions. Once you move or take an action or a Reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

    #
    background-story: |
     Sylvan Elves aren't limited to a certain locale. In fact, being animistic, many tribes have aligned themselves with particular facets of the wild. Nokumi's tribe, self-entitled that Nation of Nac Mac, have settled
     throughout the tributaries and banks of the great Thaad River [Any Grand River] and exemplify how the spirituality of the Sylvan Elves has diversified and refined itself to various aspects of the wilderness. They are a
     nomadic peoples whose patterns resemble that of a tiger around these flowing fingers of water. They draw their shamanic energies and histories of lore from the ecology and happenings that constitute the rapids and still
     bodies that make up the area. Although their culture focuses on these waters, their knowledge of nature and the region is far from limited by it. They are expert guides and trackers. Nokumi is no exception. She can
     lead most travelers to almost anywhere in the region through easy or difficult terrain, often showing her patrons short cuts or means of survival. Her entourage of pets are more akin to friends who follow her in return for
     her love and kindness. They are all almost attuned to one another as an arcane caster might be attuned to her familiar. Eschewing most material wealth, as is custom for her peoples, Nokumi will often only accept tools
     or clothing in return for her guidance.

    personality: |
      Nokumi is a kind and generous soul. She loves the forest and all of its animal denizens. She helps them and they help her. She is always happy to guide people through her woods as much for the sake of helping as it is to
      prevent travellers from damaging the woods
