    background-story: |
      <p>The Ter family have been free of the Underdark for generations. Having integrated themselves well within the community of the Town/City of Allaris [Any minor or major Town or City with decent traffic], they have found an abundant life as traders, innkeepers, barkeeps, and the like. Giza remains close with her family and, because of their adaptation of dislocation into comfortable living, she promotes the values of hearth and home as a mindset, rather than a bloodline or geographical location.</p>
