    background-story: |
      Vrakoom's family has a long tradition of serving as clerics of the Selesnya Conclave and started his training at a young age. Growing up in the light of Trostani, he is a true believer and has strong faith in the teachings of the conclave. These teachings are where he derive's his power. 
      Large, even for a loxodon, he was groomed as a front line healer and has seen his fair share of battles for his young age (about 70 years old), mostly against Gruul raids, but also during the War of the Spark. As a result, he is as competent with a a mace and shield as he is with a healing hand
