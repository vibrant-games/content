# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Gunslinger Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Firearm Proficiency
    - content: You gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms.
    - title: Gunsmith
    - content: You gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and 
               intricate firearms are only available through crafting.
               Firearm Properties - Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that 
                                    property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.
               Reload - The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.
               Misfire - Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until 
                         you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be 
                         mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.
               Explosive - Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, 
                           the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.
    - title: Adept Marksman
    - content: You learn to perform powerful Trick Shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms. Trick Shots. You learn two trick shots of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. 
               Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack. You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
               Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.
               Trick Shots
               Bullying Shot - You can use the powerful blast and thundering sound of your firearm to shake the resolve of a creature. You can expend one grit point while making a Charisma (Intimidation) check to gain advantage on 
                               the roll.
               Dazing Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to dizzy your opponent. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Constitution saving throw 
                             or suffer disadvantage on attacks until the end of their next turn.
               Deadeye Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to gain advantage on the attack roll.
               Disarming Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to shoot an object from their hands. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a 
                                Strength saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object be pushed 10 feet away from you.
               Forceful Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to trip them up and force them back. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a 
                               Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you.
               Piercing Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to fire through multiple opponents. The initial attack gains a +1 to the firearm’s misfire score. On a hit, 
                               the creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target within your first range increment. Only the initial attack 
                               can misfire.
               Violent Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one or more grit points to enhance the volatility of the attack. For each grit point expended, the attack gains a +2 to the firearm’s 
                              misfire score. If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage die per grit point spent when determining the damage.
               Winging Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to topple a moving target. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Strength saving throw 
                              or be knocked prone.
    - title: Grit 4
    - content: You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
               You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM’s discretion). You regain all 
               expended grit points after a short or long rest. Saving Throws. Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated 
               as follows; Trick shot save DC = 19

               someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature. You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 
               1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table. 
               Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest. 
               When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest; two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir 
               requires its own flask.

    background-story: |
      Uha "Boomer" Bannock was enamored with fire at a very early age. Not an unusual thing for Viashino, but him moreso than most. Very early he began experimenting with combustibles and heading down the path of an alchemist. 
      At the age of 12 one of his experiments went awry and burned down his house, killing his entire family, yet he managed to escape without a scratch. In an effort to atone for his fatal mistake he began to use his skills 
      against beings that he considered evil. Monsters, fiends, undead. As an extension of his alchemical pursuits, he stumbled his was into discovering and mastering firearms. During a failed attempt to take out a den of 
      ghouls, Boomer was found, being overwhelmed, by The Phantom, who saved his life and invited him to join his fledgling organization. Finding a new focus for his guilt, he happily joined The Dead Hunters and devoted his 
      life to the gods of good and building towards his redemption.

    personality: |
      Uha "Boomer" Bannock is a large, scaly reptilian man with a protruding snout full of sharp teeth, yellow eyes, a long, thick prehensile tail with sharp scales and a serrated bone protrusion at the end.  He wears a tailored 
      leather armored vest and pants full of pockets and pouches. He is as excitable and fiery as his weapon of choice. He's quick to anger, often to his detriment. He generally manages to keep his composure in the heat of 
      battle against the Dead Hunter's quarries of choice, but dealing with regular people tends to brnig out the worst of him, and quickly. When it comes to his alchemical work and his explosives he is cool as a cucmber, 
      attentive and diligent. Exceptionally detail oriented in his work, but there is still nothing he enjoys more than a good explosion.
