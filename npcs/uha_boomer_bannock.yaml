# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Uha "Boomer" Bannock was enamored with fire at a very early age. Not an unusual thing for Viashino, but him moreso than most. Very early he began experimenting with combustibles and heading down the path of an alchemist. 
      At the age of 12 one of his experiments went awry and burned down his house, killing his entire family, yet he managed to escape without a scratch. In an effort to atone for his fatal mistake he began to use his skills 
      against beings that he considered evil. Monsters, fiends, undead. As an extension of his alchemical pursuits, he stumbled his was into discovering and mastering firearms. During a failed attempt to take out a den of 
      ghouls, Boomer was found, being overwhelmed, by The Phantom, who saved his life and invited him to join his fledgling organization. Finding a new focus for his guilt, he happily joined The Dead Hunters and devoted his 
      life to the gods of good and building towards his redemption.

    personality: |
      Uha "Boomer" Bannock is a large, scaly reptilian man with a protruding snout full of sharp teeth, yellow eyes, a long, thick prehensile tail with sharp scales and a serrated bone protrusion at the end.  He wears a tailored 
      leather armored vest and pants full of pockets and pouches. He is as excitable and fiery as his weapon of choice. He's quick to anger, often to his detriment. He generally manages to keep his composure in the heat of 
      battle against the Dead Hunter's quarries of choice, but dealing with regular people tends to brnig out the worst of him, and quickly. When it comes to his alchemical work and his explosives he is cool as a cucmber, 
      attentive and diligent. Exceptionally detail oriented in his work, but there is still nothing he enjoys more than a good explosion.
