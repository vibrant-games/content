    background-story: |
      Raise as a druid by his people and initiated into the Golgari Guild at a young age for training, he has an extensive knowledge of the routes and pathways through Ravnic's UnderCity. The UnderCity is a dangerous place filled with rot, decay and other not so nice things.  He was injured during his ascension trial to become a full Golgari Spore Priest, accounting for his limp, and still holds a grudge against the elf who caused the injury. One day he'll get his payback. In the meantime, He takes pride, probably too much pride, in getting the Golgari High Council's guests safely through the UnderCity unscathed.
