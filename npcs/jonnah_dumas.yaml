# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Doctor Abilities
  - abilities:
    - title: Medical Training
    - content: Due to your meticulous study into the healing arts you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for Medicine checks. In addition your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
               Medicine checks that you make. 
    - title: First Aid
    - content: You can apply basic first aid to an adjacent creature you can touch. As a bonus action you heal the target for 1d4 hit points. This increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th
               level (4d4). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier + 1. You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
    - title: Second Opinion
    - content: You have become accustomed not only to combat, but to coordinating with other healers. Whenever an ally within 20ft of you uses a healing ability, spell, or item, you can use your reaction to increase
               the amount healed to a single target by half, rounded up. Your ally must be able to see or hear you.
    - title: Patch Up
    - content: You have learned that there is always another fight around the corner, and it's best to be ready for it. Select up to 6 willing creatures that you can touch. You spend the next 10 minutes quickly stitching up
               any open wounds and applying painkillers where needed, whatever it takes to get them to the next battle. This cures them of any non-magical ailments and restores a number of hit points equal to half of their
               maximum rounded up. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier divided by two (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
    - title: Diagnosis
    - content: You have learned to treat hostile scenarios as just another day at the office. As an action you study a living creature and gain vital insight towards its physical state. You learn one of the targets
               following statistics - Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, Highest Saving Throw, Lowest Saving Throw, or whether or not the creature is below half its health. You can use this
               feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
    - title: Paramedic
    - content: You have become experienced at reaching the injured without taking damage. When you use your action to disengage you may also double your movement speed until the end of your turn
    - title: Vaccination
    - content: You have spent countless hours attempting to aid those suffering from disease and have developed a number of treatments. As an action you can cure a target of a single disease afflicting them. Alternatively,
               you can inoculate a target against disease for the next 24 hours. In addition, due to exposure from numerous patients the doctor gains immunity to all disease.
    - title: Vitality Boost
    - content: You have become an expert at healing at a moment’s notice. As an bonus action you can heal an adjacent creature you can touch for 4d6 hit points. This increases by 2d6 when you reach 15th level (6d6).
               You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier + 1. You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
    - title: Reanimation
    - content: You provide life saving aid to a creature that has died within the last 10 minutes and return them to life. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This procedure can't return to life a creature that
               has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. You cannot use this feature again until you have completed a short rest.
    - title: Experianced Healer
    - content: You are unlikely to fail at common medical tasks. Whenever you make a Medicine check you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
    - title: Sedate
    - content: You have managed to create sedatives using standard supplies. As an action you can inject a willing creature with a sedative that will cause them to go unconscious for 1d4 hours. You can also attempt to inject
               an unwilling creature for the same effect. An unwilling target must be below one quarter of its maximum hit points for this ability to take effect. They must then succeed a Constitution saving throw or
               immediately fall unconscious for 1d4 hours.
  - title: Surgeon Domain Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Expert Practice
    - content: You can now add your intelligence modifier to the result of any healing ability you perform.
    - title: Surgery
    - content: You have gained the confidence to delve deeper into the bodies of your patients. You operate on an injured subject, curing them of any ailments, both mundane and magical. The target regains a number of hit points
               equal to their maximum. Any hit points the target gains over their maximum become temporary hit points. This takes 2 full hours from start to finish. 
    - title: Transplant
    - content: You have begun experimenting with new methods to improve life. you may attempt to transplant an organ from one creature to another. The organ must be from a living creature or one that has died in the last 
               24 hours. Examples are eyes from a creature with darkvision, stomach from a creature inmmune to poison, or replace a limb with one from a smiilar creature. the process takes 2 hours to complete and takes 2 
               days to recover from. This requres a Medicine check from the chart below, The DM determines the difficulty level;
    - content: Difficulty   DC     Example
    - content: Simple       DC15   Human Leg
    - content: Moderate     DC20   Elf Eyes
    - content: Difficult    DC25   Dragon Stomach

  - title: Special Equipment
  - abilities:
    - title: Doctors Bag
    - content: You gain access to a number of special supplies due to your medical training. These supplies include things like bandages, syringes, medicinal powders, and healing salves. You keep these in a storage
               container of your choice such as a bag, a series of pouches, or even a trunk. As long as you have access to your Doctor's Bag you may use an action to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without
               needing to make a Medicine check.
    - title: High Surgeon's Scalpel
    - content: When used as a weapon it counts as a magical dagger and deals 2d4 slashing damage
    - content: Medical Mastery - Grants advantage on all medicine checks made during surgical operations
    - content: Cutting Edge - When attacking with this weapon, if you score a critical hit, the target takes and extra 14 slashing damage
    - content: Cauterize- You may use a bonus action to super-heat its blade for 1 minute or until you end the effect. this causes the scalpel to deal and additional 1d8 fire damage and can immediately cauterize any wound.
                          This ability can only be used once per long rest
    - title: Amulet of Winter's Sleep
    - content: This amulet allows its wearer to expend one charge to cast a variation of the sleep spell on 1 target creature per charge. Target creatures must make a DC10 Constitution Saving Throw or fall into a deep sleep.
               This sleep lasts for 1 hour and can only be ended early by the caster or by dispelling the magic. If the original saving throw is failed, the wearer can use an additional charge to extend the sleep for an extra
               hour without another saving throw. The sleep state can also be entered willingly by a target without a saving throw. The target of this sleep spell also takes an additional 1d6 cold damage per hour of sleep. This
               amulet has 1d6 charges and regains 1d6 charges every day at dawn.

    background-story: |
      As a family of oddities and abominations, it's not always a good idea for Dumas family members to visit standard medical professionals. Not to mention that most doctors wouldn't even know where to begin.  To this end,
      when a young Cousin Jonnah showed high intelligenct and an early predaliction towards dissection at a very young age, it was decided that he would be sent off to school to apprentice to be a doctor and a surgeon. Jonnah
      took to his calling with fuvor and became exceedingly adept in medicine and surgery. Of his own accord, he also delved deeply into the discipline of transplanting body parts, changing normal people into abominations by 
      grafting parts and organs from various non-humanoid species into them. When he completed his official studies, he returned home to his clan and continues to teach himself new and taboo techniques.

    personality: |
      Jonah Dumas is a ruggedly handsome young man with well-kept hair and manicured hands. The only visible sign that he is anything other than normal is his two different colored eyes. He is calm, intelligent, confident,
      well-spoken and deft. He has very little in the way of bedside manner, but can still be very charming when he needs to be.
