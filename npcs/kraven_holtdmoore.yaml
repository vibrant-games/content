# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

       - Pounce: (Tiger or Hybrid Form Only). If the weretiger moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or
                 be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the weretiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action

   - - Swashbuckler Abilities:
       - Fancy Footwork: you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest
                         of your turn
       - Rakish Audacity: You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your
                          Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still
                          apply to you.

       - Font of Inspiration: they regain all of their expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when they finish a short or Long Rest
       - Countercharm: As an action, they can start a Performance that lasts until the end of their next turn. During that time, them and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of them have advantage on Saving Throws against 
                       being Frightened or Charmed
                       
   - - College of Ink Abilities:
       - Connoisseur of Symbols: you have advantage on any ability check that you make using Arcana, History, Nature, Religion or your Tattooist’s Supplies or Calligrapher’s Supplies proficiencies to determine the nature of a
                                 tattoo, sigil, or symbol. This includes symbols using a language you do not understand, so long as the symbol is mostly comprised of other shapes and images. This allows you to identify magic
                                 tattoos with a successful check as well as understand basic warnings and information communicated through markings
       - Lasting Inspiration: you can imbue your Bardic Inspiration into a tattoo. When you are tattooing someone, you may expend all remaining uses of your Bardic Inspiration to imbue one Bardic Inspiration die into the tattoo.
                              The tattoo receives your current Bardic Inspiration die and does not increase when you increase in level. Once the tattoo is complete, the bearer may use a bonus action to activate the tattoo, adding
                              your Bardic Inspiration die to their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once the recipient has used the tattoo in this fashion, it cannot be used again until they complete a long rest.
                              You may add Lasting Inspiration to any tattoo you craft, be it magical or not. Adding Lasting Inspiration to a magical tattoo does not impact or impede its other effects in any way. Once your Bardic
                              Inspiration die has increased, you may spend one hour performing a touch up on a tattoo you have previously invested with Lasting Inspiration. At the end of the hour, you expend one use of your
                              Bardic Inspiration. Once this is complete, the Lasting Inspiration die increases to your current Bardic Inspiration die. You cannot perform touch ups in this way on another artist’s tattoos. In
                              addition, you are now considered to have achieved the necessary tattoo artist notoriety required to study under an established tattoo adept, even if you have never maintained a shop

      Kraven is a crafty combatant. He will rarely take his weretiger form. When in human form he will keep distance at first, using his longbow and magic. Otherwise, he engages with his scimitars. When pressed he will retreat to a secluded area and transform to slay his opponents.

    #
    background-story: |
      Kraven is not infected. He is what one would call a 'true' weretiger born of the breed in the jungles of Khuile [Any isolated vilage of Weretigers]. Set upon a collection of river mouths draining into the sea, he and his
      brood were also skilled sea-men. His clan claim to be descendents of the original weretigers and remain staunchly noble in their dealings with others with the hopes of changing public opinion towards lycanthropes.
      Kraven set forth on such an information campaign but was met with rebukes and violence. His lycanthropic form was incredibly dangerous in defence of many violent altercations, many of which unfortunately resulted in
      murders. Kraven thus turned his hand to what was in his heart: sailing, artwork, shadows, magic, mystery, and music. Combining these passions, Kraven is one of the first and only tattoo artists in the region who can
      offer magic tattoos - at a costly price.

    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Kraven is a sly and cunning individual, but hides it under a facade of jovial pleasantness. He loves a good chat, or a rousing song, but he's definitely not afraid to fight if hes pressed to it. He's smooth and charasmatic
      and has no problem expressing his pansexuality
