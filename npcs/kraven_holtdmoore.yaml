    background-story: |
      <p>Kraven is not infected. He is what one would call a 'true' weretiger born of the breed in the jungles of Khuile [Any isolated vilage of Weretigers]. Set upon a collection of river mouths draining into the sea, he and his brood were also skilled sea-men. His clan claim to be descendents of the original weretigers and remain staunchly noble in their dealings with others with the hopes of changing public opinion towards lycanthropes.</p><p>Kraven set forth on such an information campaign but was met with rebukes and violence. His lycanthropic form was incredibly dangerous in defence of many violent altercations, many of which unfortunately resulted in murders.</p><p>Kraven thus turned his hand to what was in his heart: sailing, artwork, shadows, magic, mystery, and music. Combining these passions, Kraven is one of the first and only tattoo artists in the region who can offer magic tattoos - at a costly price.</p>
