# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      The high elves of the Northern Expanse have remained stoic in their pursuit of peace with the surrounding Nations. This is exemplified in their various treatises. Hailing from this environment sounds near idyllic and its
      peoples destined for greatness in politics. Well, perhaps only half of this is true. Over her 150 years, for sure, Libil has achieved political prominence in the regional Merchants's Guild. She has been an important
      figure in the negotiations between the various increasingly expanding trading companies that threatened to put a stranglehold on individual merchants. Libil established, nearly single-handedly, the regulations for these
      companies and the available guilds for the individual merchants on the ground. Libil's upbringing among the purportedly peaceful High Elves should bespeak the formation of a law-abiding character. Her knowledge of
      their inner-workings led her astray from this destiny. Instead, Libil learned that the High Elves, out of survival or desperation, had been conducting various unethical surgical strikes against surrounding Nations;
      unethical because they betrayed the expectations of the treatises and were kept out of the public eye. This led Libil to pursue the art of inquisition, of unearthing the truth of a situation, and drove her in a
      long-standing bid as High Journeyman of the Regional Thieves' Guild. Instead of abiding by laws that seemed to only mask the horrible truths that underpin the appearance of peace, She seeks to achieve true peace and
      stability for 'boots on the ground' through the unionization structures that guilds bring. She can often be found in the busiest marketplaces of large towns and cities, directing traffic, solving squabbles, and
      enlisting merchants to join the guild (both Merchants' and Thieves' (the latter often referenced, instead, as 'Workers' Guild', or 'Commoners' Association', or something of that ilk)

    #
    personality: |
      Libil is a champion of the common man. In oppositrion to her upbringing among the High Elves, she has a strong aversion to authority figures and believes strongly in the need for and power of unions in controlling the
      exploitation of commoners by nobility and corporations. She is fierce and smart and cool under pressure. She always knows everything thats going on around her and isn't afraid to direct traffic or give orders when
      necessary
