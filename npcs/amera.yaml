    background-story: |
      Amera is considerably older than she appears to be. Around 200 years old, though in appearance they are around 25. Urban sprawl forced them from their cliff-side home. As a result they took up a job as a sailor allowing them to travel and be constantly on the move. They also regularly change ships and crews as often as possible to prevent people from learning the truth about what they are. They will usually serve as both a lookout and entertainment on the ships, they will also occasionally function as a companion for the ships captain if the mood takes them. If they need to, they can transform and escape from a situation underwater. They're main goal is their own continued survival as well as mating and perpetuating it's species
