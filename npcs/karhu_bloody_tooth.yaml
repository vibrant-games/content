# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Path of the Zealot Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Divine Fury

               The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

               spell on you.
    - title: Fanatical Focus
    - content: The divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.
    - title: Zealous Presence
    - content: You learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you
               that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Rage Beyond Death
    - content: The divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you 
               suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still
               have 0 hit points.

               any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities. You 
               can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Slayers Prey
    - content: You can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each 
               turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different 
               creature.
               
  - title: The Sweet Science Fight Club Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Cross Counter
    - content: You can block the brunt of an attack and launch one of your own in the same fluid motion. You can use your reaction and spend 2 moxie points to reduce the damage of a melee weapon attack made against you 
               by 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your pugilist level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can make an unarmed strike, or pugilist weapon attack, against a creature within range as part of the same 
               reaction.

    background-story: |
      Ursin Storm-for-Eyes is the ancient and wise spiritual leader of the Bearkin Nation. He shares leadership of his people with the nation's war leader; Bjorn Bloody-Fangs as well as the council of elders. No one is quite 
      sure how old Ursin is, himself included. But do to his experience and power as a shaman, he has for the most part ceased to age at this point. He has been the spiritual leader of the nation for as long as anyone can 
      remember, so long that he is the only one alive that knows of his upbringing and training. Ursin was a member of a small tribe made up of foundlings of many different races. Their leader and his mentor was a powerful
      shaman by the name of Grey Crow. Grey Crow spent much of their time comuning with nature spirits and gods, until one day she was touched and corrupted by dark forces. When her spirit returned to her body, she was 
      completely mad, and preceeded to slaugher her entire tribe. Ursin was the only member of Grey Crow's tribe that managed to survive the massacre, although it cost him his eyesight. During the battle, Ursin saw his own 
      death. It will come in a final battle against Grey Crow, erasing her taint from the world. After that, Ursin travelled the world on his own for many years, practising and developing his powers, until he came across a
      young tribe of Bearkin, people like him, that he'd never seen before. The tribe took in the old blind man and soon began to follow his insight and wisdom. Under his tutilage, the tribe continued to grow and expand into
      the modern Bearkin Nation as it is today. Ursin leads his nation with wisdom and compassion, while preparing them for the coming fight at the end of days.

    personality: |
      Ursin Storm-for-Eyes is a quiet, reserved but very intense man. You can tell he once wore the black and white markings of a great panda, but the black has all faded to grey. He is a wise, patient and inspiring leader. He
      is able to lead swiftly and decisively because he has seen what is coming and seen his own end. He has trained generations of Bearkin shamans and has worked tirelessly for centuries to prepare his people for the coming 
      battle, but he is becoming tired.
