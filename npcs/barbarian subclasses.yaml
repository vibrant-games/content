   - - Path of the Beast Abilities:
       - Form of the Beast: when you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your 
                            Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal. You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage;
                            Bite: Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you 
                                  regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.
                            Claws: Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the 
                                   Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.
                            Tail: You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use 
                                  your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
       - Bestial Soul: the feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You 
                       can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish a short or long rest;
                       - You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
                       - You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
                       - When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.
       - Infectious Fury: when you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
                          Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice);
                          - The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
                          - Target takes 2d12 psychic damage.
                          You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Call the Hunt: the beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing 
                        creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends
                        the chosen creatures can use the following benefit once on each of their turns; when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to 
                        the damage equal to the number rolled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                        
                        
                        
   - - Path of the Berserk Abilities:
       - Fenzy: can go into a Frenzy when he rages. If he does so, for the Duration of his rage he can make a single melee weapon Attack as a Bonus Action on each of his turns after this one. When his rage ends, 
                he suffer one level of Exhaustion
       - Mindless Rage: you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.
       - Intimidating Presence: you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must 
                                succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your 
                                action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet 
                                away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
       - Retaliation: when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
       
       
       
   - - Path of the Ancestral Guardian Abilities:
         - Ancestral Protectors: spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until 
                                 the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has 
                                 resistance to the damage of the target’s attacks.
         - Spirit Shield: the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to 
                          reduce that damage by 2d6. When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more; by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.
         - Consult the Spirits: you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a 
                                spherical sensor, this use of Clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either spell
                                in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
         - Vengeful Ancestors: your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage that your Spirit Shield 
                               prevents.
                               
                               
                               
   - - Path of the Battlerager Abilities:
         - Restriction: Dwarves Only. Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture. Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. 
                        The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.
         - Battlerager Armor: you gain the ability to use spiked armor as a weapon. While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a 
                              target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Additionally, when you use the Attack action to 
                              grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.
         - Reckless Abandon: when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.
         - Battlerager Charge: you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.
         - Spiked Retribution: when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor.
         
         
         
   - - Path of the Storm Herald Abilities:
         - Storm Aura: you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and 
                       you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your 
                       environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class. If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

         - Storm Soul: the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.
                       - Desert: You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that 
                                 isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

         - Shielding Storm: you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.
         - Raging Storm: the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.
                         - Desert: Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire 
                                   damage equal to your Barbarian level.
                         - Sea: When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck

                         - Tundra: Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 
                                    until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.
                                    
                                    
                                    
   - - Path of the Totem Warrior Abilities:

         - Totem Spirit: when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, 
                         teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be 
                         unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow. Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. 
                         For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.
                         - Bear: While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
                         - Eagle: While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. 
                                  The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.
                         - Elk: While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.
                         - Tiger: While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.
                         - Wolf: While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.

                                - Elk: Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps
                                       you roam far and fast.
                                - Tiger: You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.
                                - Wolf: You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.
         - Spirit Walker: you can cast the Commune with Nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the
                          information you seek.
         - Totemic Attunement: you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

                                       is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.
                               - Eagle: While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you
                                        aloft.
                               - Elk: While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your 
                                      Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.
                               - Tiger: While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to 
                                        make an additional melee weapon attack against it.

   - - Path of the Zealot Abilities:
         - Divine Fury: you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your Barbarian level.
                        The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.
         - Warrior of the Gods: your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as Raise Dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the 
                                spell on you.
         - Fanatical Focus: the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.
         - Zealous Presence: you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you
                             that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
         - Rage Beyond Death: the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows. While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you 
                              suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still
                              have 0 hit points.
                              
                              
                              
   - - Path of Wild Magic Abilities:
         - Magic Awareness: as an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn’t 
                            behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses 
                            when you finish a long rest.
         - Wild Surge: the magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced. If the effect requires a saving throw, the 
                       DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
                       Wild Surge Table:
                       d8  Effect
                       1   Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. You also gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 plus your 
                           barbarian level.
                       2   You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.
                       3   An intangible spirit, which looks like a flumph or a pixie (your choice), appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, 
                           the spirit explodes, and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again, summoning another 
                           spirit, on each of your turns as a bonus action.
