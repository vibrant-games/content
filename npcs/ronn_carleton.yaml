# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     While there is little known about their origins, Ronn appears as a middle-aged adult human. Yet there are numerous questions and myths that swirl throughout the realms as to their origins. See, Ronn is far too well-read
     and intelligent to be of mundane or mortal origins. They have accrued such a wealth of knowledge and capacity to teach others that most merchants, even nobles, covet their abilities and - especially - their satchel
     Consequently, They have learned to ensure their own safety by enlisting the help of adventurers and mercenaries to protect them. Their guidelines for their protectors is to maintain distant as not to gain unwanted
     attention, to permit free movement, and to not scare off the inquisitive; whom they welcome with open arms. Ronn has a serious wanderlust, rarely staying in one town, city, or village for more than a week or two to spread
     their love of knowledge and accumulate even greater wealth. Asexual and, in fact, without any noticeable confirmation of biological sex, they request that others use a variety of always changing pronouns when addressing
     them. 

 
      
    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Ronn is an enigma. They are clearly well-read and knowledgeable and are happy to teach what they know for the right price. They have a biting and sarcastic wit and aren't afraid to use it. They seem to be at least
     moderately skilled in almost every discipline. Their level of knowledge indicates that they are much much older, and much less human than they appear to be.
