# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Pact Boon
    - content: Pact of the Blade - You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. 
                                   This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 
                                   minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by 
                                   performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it 
                                   into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact 
                                   weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the 
                                   extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
    - title: Mystic Arcanum
    - content: You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
               At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way - one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain 
               all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

    - title: Form of Dread
    - content: As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed;
               You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.
               Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of 
               your next turn.
               You are immune to the frightened condition.
               You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your 
               patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your face might transform into bat-like features due to your vampire patron.
    - title: Grave Touched
    - content: Your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, 
               you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.
    - title: Mortal Husk
    - content: Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic 
               damage. In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can cause your body to explode. Each creature within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level. You then revive
               with 1 hit point in your previous space, along with your gear, and you gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you revive this way, you can’t do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.
    - title: Spirit Projection
    - content: Your body is now simply a vessel for your spirit. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation. Your 
               spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body 
               magically teleports to your spirit’s space (your choice). While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits;
               Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
               When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.
               You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
               While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
               Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

    background-story: |
      Solomon Dumas, youngest brother of Nicodeamus and Irini Dumas, is dead. Has been for a while. Solomon is is the third child of Delores Dumas, but unlike her other two children, no one is quite sure who the father was, but
      it is widley assumed that it was either Basil or Jedediah. Regardless, of his parentage, Solomon was always slow witted and animalistic. He imprinted at a very young age on his brother Nicodeamus and the two formed a stong
      bond of loyalty. As the unwanted and unexpected grandchild, Grandmother Anastasia used Solomon for many experiments and rituals culminating in his death, driving a further wedge between her and brother Nicodeamus.
      Solomon did not stay in his grave for very long though. Returning as an awakened ghast, it wasn't long before Nicodeamus realized that his little brother's undead form had, in fact, become a direct conduit to the family's
      Patron. Acting as both guiding spirit and warlock patron for the bestial youngest sibling, at times the Patron has even completely possesed Solomon's body for short lengths. Nicodeamus has so far successfully kept this 
      little detail from the rest of the family

    personality: |
      Solomon Dumas is borderline feral. He's a huge man, standing just under 7ft tall and covered in wirey muscle. He is barely in posession a child's intellect and even in undeath defers to the dictates of his loving and
      protective older brother. He fights with the ferocity of a crazed animal, but is also incredibly sly and cunning and will use his magical abilities to their fullest.
