# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Arcane Armor
    - contnet: Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand. 
    - content: You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor;
    - content: If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
    - content: You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
    - content: The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any 
               missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
    - content: The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.
    - title: Armor Model
    - content: You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models; Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it. Each model includes
               a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. You can change the armor's model whenever you 
               finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.
    - title: Guardian
    - content: You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features
    - title: Thunder Gauntlets
    - content: Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has 
               disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.
    - title: Defensive Field
    - content: As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you 
               doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Infiltrator
    - content: You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features;
    - content: Lightning Launcher - A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, 
                                    and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.
    - content: Powered Steps - Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
    - content: Dampening Field - You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.  
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Armor Modifications
    - content: You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature; armor (the chest piece), 
               boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's model with the Armor Model feature. In 
               addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.
  - title: Rogue Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Expertise
    - content: Double proficiency bonus with Thieve's Tools and Sleight of Hand
    - title: Sneak Attack

    - title: Uncanny Dodge
    - content: When an attacker she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her Reaction to halve the damage 
    - title: Evasion

               the Sending spell from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell. Once Sending is cast through
               the stones, they can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical.

    background-story: |
      Sorsha Silvanya is roughly 400 years old and spent a long time as a spy for her people in lands of men. About 70 or so years ago, she discovered an interest in artifice, especially in communication technologies. She not 
      only sees it as an avenue to improve her reconnaissance skills, but as a potential way to improve society as a whole and possibly make a significant amount of money. Her work in developing these technologies attracted 
      the attention of Oswald Vardklemp and the Collegium, She saw it as an opportunity to advance her work and to keep an eye the other members and their work. She has a strong woking knowledge of communication magics but 
      is attempting to develop communication technologies that don't require the use of magic (ie. telephony) so they are available for all people.

    personality: |
      Sorsha Silvanya is a shorter, thin, High Elf with long light-brown hair that she almost always wear pinned-up in a bun. She has pretty, but sharp features, a youthful appearance that belies her actual age. She is cool and 
      cunning. Reserved, but capable of playing at personable and pleasant.  She carries herself with the standard High Elf snootiness, but for her it's more of an air that she uses to hide her ruthlessness. She does however 
      have a streak of altruism and does ligitimately want to use the technology she is developing to benefit society as a whole, not just for her own and her people's benefits
