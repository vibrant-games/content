# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

      Soulknife Abilities:
      - Psionic Talents:
        - Description: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways - Psionic Talent Die is d8
          Psi-Bolstered Knack: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially
                                 turning failure into success
          Psychic Whisper:  As an action, you give yourself and at least one other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose
                            creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically

                             rest
          Psychic Blades: You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. When you are about to make a melee or ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free
                          hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals
                          psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals
                          damage. After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The
                          damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.
          Soul Blades: 
          - Description: Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you finer control over them in the following ways
            Homing Strikes: If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to
                            hit, your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size, regardless of the number rolled
            Psychic Teleportation: If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can hurl your Psychic Blades to magically transport yourself to another location. As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic
                                   Blades and throw it at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 5 times the highest number on your Psionic Talent die. You then teleport to that space,
                                   the blade vanishes, and your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size

    special-abilities:
    - Proficiencies: Disguise; Persuasion; Forgery Kit
    attacks: |
      1 attack with Soul Knife
    combat-tactics: |
      Glem is quite courageous, but not foolhardy. He knows his limits. He will use his psionics to disorient opponents in order to calm a situation or make space to flee. If pressed, he will try negotiating before combat
    special-equipment:
    - Gloves of Fast Draw: can teleport any item on your person to your hand. Attunement may be necessary. Grip the items you want to fast draw. Hold them the way you want them to appear in your hand and say the command word
                            /"remember/". Any time after an item has been attuned it can be reflexively teleported to your hand. The item must be on your person for this to work.
      Contraband Concealment Container: When this item is created the creator selects a material - spice, coin, or any other mundane material and a command word. The container has a seemingly endless source of whatever mundane
                                        object is selected though it deteriorates from existence within a day of being removed from the container. When the command word is spoken and the container is opened it reveals completely
                                        different contents. Stored in an extraplanar space the container may store any amount that would make sense for the size of the container and then by shutting the container the bag will
                                        store the contents away until the command word is spoken again.

    #
    background-story: |
      The rise of empires has witnessed the mixing of races geographically and biologically. Hill Dwarves and Halflings have not only made peace but also engaged in mutually beneficial trade and craftsmanship. The villas of
      Jhandoo Marr - multiple settlements within the crags of the Eastern Fingers - are connected by various rope bridges and pulley trams. The populations of these villas combined the Halfling aptitude for creating fine
      clothes, textiles, and foods with Hill Dwarf expertise with gemology, metallurgy, and construction. Not only has this alliance produced goods of wondrous value to the region but also unique individuals with a new
      mix of talents that the Realms have not yet seen. The mixing of minds had generated a large population of peoples with psionic abilities. Growing up in this culturally rich and diverse environment, Glem's psionics grew
      quickly, as did his recognition of the evolution of personal identity as an avenue for personal gain. He was able to see into peoples' minds and personal identities and quickly gather the worth of identity to each
      individual, to each merchant, to the Bureau, and beyond. He thought to himself often, if the Bureau of Population Control can mete out fees and fines for not having proper documents to prove who you are and what
      blood flows through your veins, then any of us can jump in on that process and, say, sift off a few coins here and there. With the proper expertise, of course. And it wasn't long before he sought training from the
      local guild of Identity Traders; a faction dedicated to undermining the controls imposed by the Bureau. It was here that he perfected his skills at forgery, made connections within the community, and grew his notoriety as
      the 'go-to' for illegal documents required for trade, travel, and more.
