# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    #
    background-story: |
      The rise of empires has witnessed the mixing of races geographically and biologically. Hill Dwarves and Halflings have not only made peace but also engaged in mutually beneficial trade and craftsmanship. The villas of
      Jhandoo Marr - multiple settlements within the crags of the Eastern Fingers - are connected by various rope bridges and pulley trams. The populations of these villas combined the Halfling aptitude for creating fine
      clothes, textiles, and foods with Hill Dwarf expertise with gemology, metallurgy, and construction. Not only has this alliance produced goods of wondrous value to the region but also unique individuals with a new
      mix of talents that the Realms have not yet seen. The mixing of minds had generated a large population of peoples with psionic abilities. Growing up in this culturally rich and diverse environment, Glem's psionics grew
      quickly, as did his recognition of the evolution of personal identity as an avenue for personal gain. He was able to see into peoples' minds and personal identities and quickly gather the worth of identity to each
      individual, to each merchant, to the Bureau, and beyond. He thought to himself often, if the Bureau of Population Control can mete out fees and fines for not having proper documents to prove who you are and what
      blood flows through your veins, then any of us can jump in on that process and, say, sift off a few coins here and there. With the proper expertise, of course. And it wasn't long before he sought training from the
      local guild of Identity Traders; a faction dedicated to undermining the controls imposed by the Bureau. It was here that he perfected his skills at forgery, made connections within the community, and grew his notoriety as
      the 'go-to' for illegal documents required for trade, travel, and more.
