         - Turn the Faithless: You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that 
                               can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from 
                               you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that 
                               prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is 
                               revealed while it is turned.
       - Aura of Warding: ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells. At 18th level, the range of this aura 
                          increases to 30 feet.
       - Undying Sentinel: when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 
                           Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.
       - Elder Champion: you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or 
                         moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits;
                         - At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
                         - Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
                         - Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.
                         Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

       - Channel Divinity: you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
         - Champion Challenge: As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On 
                               a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from 
                               you.
         - Turn the Tide: As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma 
                          modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.
       - Divine Allegiance: when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. 
                            Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
       - Unyielding Saint: you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed or stunned.
       - Exalted Champion: your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour;
                           - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
                           - Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.
                           - You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.
                           This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
