# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Growing up in the Warrens, he was always more interested in tricks and practical jokes than he was in fighting and raiding. If goblins had class, he would have been the class clown. Because of his unwillingness to take
      almost anything seriously, possibly a joke gone wrong and/or on the wrong goblin, he was exiled from his clan. After struggling to to survive on his own for a while, Hurley fell in with a group of traveling street
      performers. After several years of honing his craft as a comedian and acrobat, he was invited to the court to audition for the lord of the land. He excelled, playing jokes on the attendees at court, insulting the lord,
      demonstrating feats dexterity. He was hired on the spot. Since then, he has grown accustomed to the comfort of his life at court. While it is demanding and occasionally stressful, he has grown to love his job and
      uses his wit and wisdom to entertain the court and from time to time, to speak truth to power.

    personality: |
      Hurley is a clown. He loves to make people laugh and keep them entertained, for which he has a gift. His life started off rough, but he never could have dreamed where it would lead. He loves the life of luxury and has
      become accustomed to it, but he never takes his life for granted and will generally go out of his way to make sure that it doesn't change
