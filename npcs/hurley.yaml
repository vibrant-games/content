    background-story: |
      <p>Growing up in the Warrens, he was always more interested in tricks and practical jokes than he was in fighting and raiding. If goblins had class, he would have been the class clown. Because of his unwillingness to take almost anything seriously, possibly a joke gone wrong and/or on the wrong goblin, he was exiled from his clan.</p><p>After struggling to to survive on his own for a while, Hurley fell in with a group of traveling street performers. After several years of honing his craft as a comedian and acrobat, he was invited to the court to audition for the lord of the land. He excelled, playing jokes on the attendees at court, insulting the lord, demonstrating feats dexterity. He was hired on the spot.  </p><p>Since then, he has grown accustomed to the comfort of his life at court. While it is demanding and occasionally stressful, he has grown to love his job and uses his wit and wisdom to entertain the court and from time to time, to speak truth to power.</p>
