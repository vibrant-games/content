# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Nobody can be sure how Scheuschzeri ended up in the ponds. But everyone knows that he hears the best of the news because he's always treading water in a well-placed pond. Scheuschzeri will spend most of his time in deeper
     waters by the wharf in the sea-side frontier village of Griptight Keep [Any Seaside Trading Village] overlorded by the pirate baron Koon The Bold. He spends daytime hours skipping out of the wharf into the various marshy
     puddles that characterize the paths of the village overhearing conversations. He's become so attuned to these interactions and the value of their content to others that he often positions himself in the best spots to
     overhear the best possible informations. How did poor Scheuschzeri become this this way? Nobody is completely certain. Some claim that he was once a pirate who had fallen in love with a Siren while at sea and upon his
     attempt to capture her heart she laughed in his face and banished him to the ponds and wharf-side. Others tell a story of how it was his own choice; that he is actually a powerful sorcerer who grew tired of his capabilities
     and cast this polymorph on himself in reverence of the greater society.

    personality: |
     Scheuschzeri is kind of a blank slate. He picks up and repeats gossip he hears as he flits around the warf and ponds around town
