    background-story: |
      <p>Nobody can be sure how Scheuschzeri ended up in the ponds. But everyone kows that he hears the best of the news because he's always treading water in a well-placed pond. Scheuschzeri will spend most of his time in deeper waters by the wharf in the sea-side frontier village of Griptight Keep [Any Seaside Trading Village] overlorded by the pirate baron Koon The Bold. He spends daytime hours skipping out of the wharf into the various marshy puddles that characterize the paths of the village overhearing conversations. He's become so attuned to these interactions and the value of their content to others that he often positions himself in the best spots to overhear the best possible informations.</p><p>How did poor Scheuschzeri become this this way? Nobody is completely certain. Some claim that he was once a pirate who had fallen in love with a Siren while at sea and upon his attempt to capture her heart she laughed in his face and banished him to the ponds and wharf-side. Others tell a story of how it was his own choice; that he is actually a powerful sorcerer who grew tired of his capabilities and cast this polymorph on himself in reverence of the greater society.</p>
