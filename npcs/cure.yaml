    background-story: |
      <p>Built <i>by</i> moneylenders <i>for</i> moneylenders, many of the battlepriests of Waukeen [or similar deity of trade and commerce] are warforged imbued with the spirit of trade and venture capitalism. While the positions of high-priests remain largely the province of avaricious humans and elves, some warforge have proven their 'mettle', so-to-speak, and climbed the ranks of the clergy.</p><p>The entire population of this church are garbed in ridiculously lavish clothing. Cure has embraced this practice...well...religiously. Since his creation he has fervently advocated the expansion of the Empire's commerce and investments, fought valiantly alongside his brothers-in-faith to protect merchant caravans, and bled speech after speech upon visiting commoners about the values of donating their lands and services to the temple for the betterment of the 'Great Machine', as they call it.</p><p>These abbots and priests and their followers can often be found in prayer to the Marketplace Eternal in the Outlands.</p><p>Cure is a fanatical follower of High Priest <a href="https://getvibrantgames.com/npc2/morion-defaye/">Morion DeFaye</a> and will almost always accompany him, whether on a trip to guard a caravan or in a ritual and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal.</p>
