# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Built by moneylenders for moneylenders, many of the battlepriests of Waukeen [or similar deity of trade and commerce] are warforged imbued with the spirit of trade and venture capitalism. While the positions of high
      priests remain largely the province of avaricious humans and elves, some warforge have proven their 'mettle', so-to-speak, and climbed the ranks of the clergy.</p><p>The entire population of this church are garbed in 
      ridiculously lavish clothing. Cure has embraced this practice...well...religiously. Since his creation he has fervently advocated the expansion of the Empire's commerce and investments, fought valiantly alongside his 
      brothers-in-faith to protect merchant caravans, and bled speech after speech upon visiting commoners about the values of donating their lands and services to the temple for the betterment of the 'Great Machine', as they 
      call it. These abbots and priests and their followers can often be found in prayer to the Marketplace Eternal in the Outlands. Cure is a fanatical follower of High Priest Morion DeFaye and will almost always 
      accompany him, whether on a trip to guard a caravan or in a ritual and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal.
