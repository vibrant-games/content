# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    skills:
   - - Barbarian Abilities:
         - Rage: Can enter a rage as a Bonus Action. 
            - have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws.
            - make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll
            - Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage          
         - Danger Sense: has advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws against Effects that he can see, such as traps and Spells
         - Reckless Attack: When making his first Attack on his Turn, he can decide to Attack recklessly. Doing so gives him advantage on melee weapon Attack Rolls using Strength during this turn, 
                            but Attack Rolls against him have advantage until his next turn
         - Extra Attack: Can attack twice each turn	
         - Fast Movement: your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy Armor.
         - Feral Instinct: you have advantage on Initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the Beginning of Combat and aren't Incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage 
                           before doing anything else on that turn.		
         - Brutal Critical: you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee Attack.
 
       
   - - Path of the Berserker Abilities:
       - Frenzy: you can go into a Frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the Duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon Attack as a Bonus Action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you
                 suffer one level of Exhaustion  
       - Mindless Rage: you can’t be Charmed or Frightened while raging. If you are Charmed or Frightened when you enter your rage, the Effect is suspended for the Duration of the rage
       - Intimidating Presence: you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must
                                succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be Frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your
                                action to extend the Duration of this Effect on the Frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This Effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of Line of Sight or more than 60 feet
                                away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours

    background-story: |
      The 2nd born son of a local baron, Draake could never stay still. As a young boy, he was formally trained as a knight. He and his brother Trassel were inseperable, but Draake knew he would never rule and he hated the pomp
      of court life. At 16 he left the castle in the night looking for adventure. He found it in a tavern where he met Taron. The two teenagers quickly became friends. Leaving his hometown of Oxlight behind him, the two
      adventured far and wide, both starting and ending many fights along the way. During this time, the charismatic Draake convinced more adventurers to join their ranks. At 24, Draake was captured on a raid and brought back
      to town. His brother, now Lord, almost didn't recognize him. Granted clemency, the two agreed to enrich each other. Trassel ensured that Draake would become the local bandit leader by sending his soldiers against
      all other gangs and in return Trassel recieved a cut from every raid. Draake would keep the gang in line and would take new recruits (criminals from Oxlight) which helped lower expenses for Trassel and made him look better
      to the king. This arrangement has persisted for the last 26 years.
