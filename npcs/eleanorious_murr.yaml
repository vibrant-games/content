    background-story: |
      <p>Eleanorious hails from a regal clan of golden Dragonborn who have integrated themselves well into the ruling population of the region. The Murr family, especially, have developed meaningful emotional and economic relationships within Xhontapys [Major Trade City] and positioned themselves well as purveyors of finer goods within its trade nexus.</p><p>With a knack for measuring volumes by eye and comprehending chemical reactions prior to mixing ingredients, Eleanorious trained with various local phylacteries and alchemists to learn this remarkable trade. She has become well-known for her expertise as well as her pleasant personality, fine work-ethic, and her good fashion sense.</p>
