      &lt;p&gt;The Shroud is actually Maria Estivan, a formerly well known traveling actress and orphanage benefactor. Her career ended when she and her husband were attacked on the road one night. He was slain and her face was scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no husband or career to support her or the orphanage they had just built together, Maria put her acting and makeup skills to work for her and created The Carnelian Shroud and began robbing wagons and carriages on horseback. As she became more and more successful, she began to recruit groups of struggling young men and sending them out into the country side in gangs to continue raising funds so she had to venture out less and less and could spend more time focusing on her orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  As the legend grew, so did the income. Now every cent that isn&#39;t being paid to her men in the field is anonymously donated to orphanages around the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
