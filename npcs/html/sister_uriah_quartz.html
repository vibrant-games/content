									<p2>Cloud Rune - This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks. In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack&#39;s effects regardless of the attack&#39;s range. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Fire Rune - This rune&#39;s magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles; the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. \ The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Frost Rune - This rune&#39;s magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Stone Rune - This rune&#39;s magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Hill Rune - (7th Level or Higher). This rune&#39;s magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant.

									<p2>Storm Rune - (7th Level or Higher). Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can&#39;t be surprised as long as you aren&#39;t incapacitated. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you&#39;re incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>

									<p2>You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute; If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn&#39;t change. You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.

									<p2>As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&#39;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&#39;t take Reactions.

									<p2>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity&#39;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can&#39;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p2><br>

									Sister Uriah Quartz grew up poor in the rougher parts of town. She learned the ways of the Rune Knight from her family, but once she went out on her own, things went south fast. Out of work and out of money she ended 
up turning to prostitution. One night while working in a brothel, a vampire paid the establishment a visit. While the beast was ravaging its way through the house, Uriah used her Rune Magic to surprise and slay the 
monster. That night she felt the blessing of the moon goddess for the first time and used her blessing to heal all of the other girls ravaged by the vampire and prevent them from turning. Feeling her new calling, 
she left her life of sin and joined a convent devoted to the goddess. She learned the ways of the Twilight Clerics and devoted her life to ridding the world of fiends and the undead. After 200+ years of fighting the 
forces of darkness, she has become one tough old bird and is not to be trifled with. In her tenure, she repeatedly crossed paths with The Phantom, eventually leaving the convent to join his Dead Hunters full time.

									Sister Uriah Quartz is tall for a dwarf, coming in at just over 5 feet tall. She is also broad and heavily muscled. She is dark-skinned with long gray hair and and a gray, braided beard. She wears the tradition nun's 
habit of her order over top of full chainmail armor. She carries a huge warhammer strapped to her back, and carries a Holy silver shield with a large moon shaped sapphire in it center that acts as her holy symbol and 
spellcasting focus. She is gruff and wise and has been around the block more than a few times. She is compassionate and loving towards her companions, and acts as a judgement-free minister and confessor for the local 
bordellos and brothels, giving solace, advice and blessings to those in need. She is also a force to be reckoned with when it comes to battling fiends and the undead. She is also one of the very few people who know 
The Phantom's secret. She is not a fan of him being undead, but she knows his story, his patrons and his mission and accepts them as valid.
