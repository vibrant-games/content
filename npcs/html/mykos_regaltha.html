The pants can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The pants weighs 15 pounds, regardless of their contents. Retrieving an item from the pants requires an action. If the pants are overloaded, pierced, or torn, they ruptures and are destroyed, and their contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the pant&#39;s pockets are turned inside out, their contents spill forth, unharmed, but the pants must be put right before they can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the pants can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Placing a pants of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random Location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

							<p1><b>Rod of Security</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it.

It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery Tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its Nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space. For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don&#39;t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the Location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that Location. The rod can&#39;t be used again until ten days have passed.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Bag of Beans</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Inside this heavy cloth bag are 6 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. If you dump the bag&#39;s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable Objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an Effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an Effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an Effect.</p2><br>

									Mykos grew up in the Underdark with his tribe of Tieflings. His father, Rophelos, was the Khan and his mother, Mytha, a Queen of their kind. As war among the denizens of the Underdark continued to rage, his tribe ceased to
worship thier traditional gods in favor of one of the old forgotten gods; Kezef, The Hound of Rot. As his tribe delved deeper into the following of Kezef, their raids became ruthless. Killing and wanton destruction for the
sake of killing and wanton destruction. The also bagan taking prisoners to use as slaves. This didn't sit well with Mykos as he had always had a pronounced sense of fairness and justice. When he brought his concerns to his
parents he was forced to fight his older brother Rophelor to the death in single combat. Mykos defeated his brother, but refused to deliver the killing blow. Mykos then escaped from his tribe, finding his way out of the 
Undrdark, taking himself into exile. Shortly after leaving the Underdark, he found a lone Half-Orc named Ordic and an exiled Drow, Etzio, and the three outcasts set out on the road of adventure, gaining fame and fortune 
over the years, becoming known as "The Forgotten". Using their new found wealth to buy a tavern, settling in the small shanty town of Phandalin, and opening Ardenthal's Rest. Recently his Brother Rophelor came back into 
his life, now also exiled from their tribe and escorted by, much to Mykos' surprise, a daughter that Mykos had never known existed.

									Mykos is average height but built like a brick wall of muscle. He has deep red skin, lang black hair and short-cropped beard. He has white eyes and thick curled horns like a ram. He wears short cut pants (pants of holding)
with his long muscular tail hanging out the back above his hoofed feat. He also wears the trophies of his triumphs, A necklace of troll teeth, the thick, red, woolen cloak of a fallen Red Wizard and the blood-soak hat of a 
slain redcap over top of the specially-made helmet that fits around his horns. He also has a large tattoo of a naked lady on his left arm. Mykos is gruff, intimidating and impetuous, often acting without thinking and 
barrelling headlong into danger, despite his acute danger sense. Once battle commences though, there are few more violent, cunning and aggressive. Despite his tendency towards violence, Mykos also has a keenly developed 
sense of fairness and justice. He also has a strong aversion to authority in general, but specifically to the tenets and intervenions of the many gods of the realm. He also has a special distatse for slavers, and a 
genuine hatred of the Red Wizards of Thay in particular. He has also been known to go out of his way to provoke any authority figure that crosses his path, especially those who see him as lesser.

with his long muscular tail hanging out the back above his hoofed feat. He also wears the trophies of his triumphs, A necklace of troll teeth, the thick, red, woolen cloak of a fallen Red Wizard and the blood-soak hat of a 
slain redcap over top of the specially-made helmet that fits around his horns. He also has a large tattoo of a naked lady on his left arm. Mykos is gruff, intimidating and impetuous, often acting without thinking and 
barrelling headlong into danger, despite his acute danger sense. Once battle commences though, there are few more violent, cunning and aggressive. Despite his tendency towards violence, Mykos also has a keenly developed 
sense of fairness and justice. He also has a strong aversion to authority in general, but specifically to the tenets and intervenions of the many gods of the realm. He also has a special distatse for slavers, and a 
genuine hatred of the Red Wizards of Thay in particular. He has also been known to go out of his way to provoke any authority figure that crosses his path, especially those who see him as lesser.
