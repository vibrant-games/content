							<p1><b>Firearm Proficiency</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Gunsmith</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Firearm Properties - Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Reload - The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Misfire - Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score).

									Tzipporah Dumas or Zippy to her friends (she doesn't have any friends), is the only daughter of Basil Dumas. She is the youngest blood member of the Dumas Family and as a result, has grown up without 
the benefit of much in the way of rules or order. Her cousin Nicodeamus has taken special interest in raising her and has taught her all that he knows of his favorite hobby, Firearms! She's a quick study and has 
become a mean gunfighter in her own right, she however, doesn't yet have access to the magic that her cousin has. When she comes of age (should she survive that long) she will take the same pact that her cousin 
took and become the family's next Hexslinger.

									Tzipporah Dumas is a slight, little, slip of a girl with hip-length, dark brown hair and big violet eyes. She is so enamored with her cousin, she has even taken up dressing like him. She is wild and carefree with 
very little respect for authority, especially that of her "stuffy" father Basil. The only authority figure she seems to respond to at all is Nicodeamus. She is obsessed with her cousin and hopes to one day either 
replace or join Irini as his wife. Though not the sharpest knife in the drawer, Tzipporah is completely fearless and will have a go at pretty much anyone or anything at anytime.
