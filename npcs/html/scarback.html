You gain proficiency with the greataxe and the maul.&quot;, &quot;Relentless Power&quot;=&gt;&quot;Nothing can stop your imense strength. When you roll a critical hit with a melee weapon, you can roll one of the weapon dice again and add it to the total.&quot;, &quot;Unstoppable Destruction&quot;=&gt;&quot;Your size and strength are unmatched. If you hit an enemy with an attack with a two-handed melee weapon, you can use your bonus action to attack one adjacent enemy within 5ft from you and the enemy you first hit with your two-handed melee weapon, though the second attack is rolled with disadvantage.&quot;, &quot;Frightful Appearance&quot;=&gt;&quot;Due to your sheer size, you would put the braves to run. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.&quot;, &quot;Bloodrage&quot;=&gt;&quot;Your blood becomes filled with your anger.

You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage -&quot;, &quot;Bite&quot;=&gt;&quot;Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice).

									When the village of Everskinnis [Any Elven village] was raided by Ogres and goblinoids, the inevitable results of the plunder and pillage was that the ravaged female escapees would birth half-breeds. Relima Haas, a young
woman and former wife of a fine hunter who fell in the raids, was among these poor women. The gestation period was more than draining and the birth fatal. Scarback was born. Scavenging for food and other sustenance
and forced to reform their beliefs and direction, the camp of survivors raised Scarback in the wilderness. He learned to value the spirits of the wild beasts and flora. He also learned the value of connecting with the rage
he felt over the abuses imparted upon his mother and her now scattered community of hunters. A small portion of these survivors refused to live in survival-mode and instead departed together to seek a better life.
Scarback followed. The 5 departees were the smarter and more talented of the group. One of these departees was a beautiful young elven woman named Bodius towards whom Scarback took a serious liking. Traveling village to
village, they would perform feats of strength and agility for coins to wrangle up food or drink. In time, they came to be known as an entertaining side-show. On one fateful night, the group encountered a particularly
vicious pack of gnolls. Scarback fought valiantly while most of the group were slain. The gnolls plundered what they could and fled while Scarback was left tending to a seriously wounded Bodius with tears in his eyes.
"Scarback love pretty elf-lady", he lamented. He tucked Bodius in the group's steamer chest and gently fed her, gave her water, and tended to her wounds as he made his way to the nearest township. Upon next opening the
steamer, Bodius was somewhat recovered and attempted to get out. "No. Elf lady not safe", Scarback proclaimed as he knocked her out with a back hand. He tied her up securely, stuffed cloth in her mouth, and closed the
chest, determined to keep Bodius safe from harm. Yet, that same day, when he made his way through town his mind encountered a serious psychological schism; he couldn't accept what he'd done and immediately began searching
for Bodius. At the same time he has an inexorable bond with his steamer trunk. Twice daily, in private, he will check on his belongings and only then recognize that Bodius remains in the chest. He will feed her and provide
her water, only to Bind and gag her and lock the steamer back up.

									Scarback is a conflicted being. A behemoth with deminished mental capacity, his poor fracured mind cannot deal with the reality of his situation. He loves and cares so deeply for Bodius that he does not want any more harm
to come to her. But in his zeal to protector her, he has denied her comfort and freedom. At the same time, a combination of massive amounts of alcohol and the power of self-denial, he mostly dissociates his mind from the
torture that he has actually perpetrated upon her. The drunker her gets, the more he wanders and laments his &quot;lost&quot; love despite her being, however unwillingly, by his side the whole time
