Scarback can focus himself to occasionally shrug off injury. When he takes damage, he can use his reaction to roll a d12. Add hisConstitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After he uses this trait, he can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n|\nRage\n&quot;, &quot;attacks&quot;=&gt;&quot;Great Axe\n|\nJavelin\n&quot;, &quot;combat-tactics&quot;=&gt;&quot;Scarback is fearless. He will almost always begin any combat by entering a rage and attacking the most powerful appearing foe.\n&quot;}, &quot;profile&quot;=&gt;{&quot;background-story&quot;=&gt;&quot;&lt;p&gt;When the village of Everskinnis [Any Elven village] was raided by Ogres and goblinoids, the inevitable results of the plunder and pillage was that the ravaged female escapees would birth half-breeds. Relima Haas, a young woman and former wife of a fine hunter who fell in the raids, was among these poor women. The gestation period was more than draining and the birth fatal. Scarback was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scavenging for food and other sustenance and forced to reform their beliefs and direction, the camp of survivors raised Scarback in the wilderness. He learned to value the spirits of the wild beasts and flora. He also learned the value of connecting with the rage he felt over the abuses imparted upon his mother and her now scattered community of hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small portion of these survivors refused to live in survival-mode and instead departed together to seek a better life. Scarback followed. The 5 departees were the smarter and more talented of the group. One of these departees was a beautiful young elven woman named Bodius towards whom Scarback took a serious liking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling village to village, they would perform feats of strength and agility for coins to wrangle up food or drink. In time, they came to be known as an entertaining side-show. On one fateful night, the group encountered a particularly vicious pack of gnolls. Scarback fought valiantly while most of the group were slain. The gnolls plundered what they could and fled while Scarback was left tending to a seriously wounded Bodius with tears in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Scarback love pretty elf-lady\&quot;, he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tucked Bodius in the group&#39;s steamer chest and gently fed her, gave her water, and tended to her wounds as he made his way to the nearest township. Upon next opening the steamer, Bodius was somewhat recovered and attempted to get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;No. Elf lady not safe\&quot;, Scarback proclaimed as he knocked her out with a back hand. He tied her up securely, stuffed cloth in her mouth, and closed the chest, determined to keep Bodius safe from harm. Yet, that same day, when he made his way through town his mind encountered a serious psychological schism; he couldn&#39;t accept what he&#39;d done and immediately began searching for Bodius. At the same time he has an inexorable bond with his steamer trunk. Twice daily, in private, he will check on his belongings and only then recognize that Bodius remains in the chest. He will feed her and provide her water, only to Bind and gag her and lock the steamer back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;}, &quot;uncategorized&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;wp:status&quot;=&gt;&quot;publish&quot;}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms&quot;=&gt;[&quot;&quot;]}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords&quot;=&gt;[]}, {&quot;ful-picture&quot;=&gt;1272}]}}</p>	</div> <!-- property line -->
