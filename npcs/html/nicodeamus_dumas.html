									<p2>You gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting. Firearm Properties - Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons. Reload - The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm. Misfire - Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

									<p2>Pact of the Blade - You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can&#39;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. - Nicodeamus&#39; Pact Weapon are his Firebrand Revolvers.</p2><br>

									<p2>You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits - You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus. Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier</p2><br>

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

									<p2>The Firebrand appears much as a normal revolver (See DMG p. 268), but its cylinder is loaded with six empty, brass cartridges. The Firebrand magically fills these empty cartridges with ammunition when the trigger is squeezed. As a result, you never need to reload the Firebrand and it does not require ammunition unless you wish to load it with magical ammunition. A cartridge manually loaded with a magical bullet but no powder does not magically generate any powder when the pistol cycles to that cartridge. If you have access to modern bullets, you can load them into the Firebrand as into a normal revolver. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the Firebrand. Additionally, you can use a bonus action to attack with the Firebrand on each of your turns, you do not add your Dexterity modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p2><br>

									Nicodeamus Dumas is the eldest grandson of Anastasia Dumas and the defacto leader of the Dumas Family cult. Pretty much since birth, Nicodeamus was raised by his grandmother Anastasia, and grew in her twisted image.
As a child, his only friends were the lesser devils that serve his grandmothers patrons. They taught him their ways, their magic, their bargains, their deceptions, and they taught him well. He grew to become a consumate
grifter, conman and liar. They taught him to play their games and to gamble. When he came of age, his grandmother introduced him to her benefactor, to whom he took an oath, brokered a deal and was rewarded with a
sizeable amount of power upon completion of his given task. At a very early age he also became fascinated with a new technology slowly appearing across the realm, firearms. His doting grandmother encouraged his new hobby
and acquired him the best pieces that could be found. He mastered handling them, repairing them, shooting them and eventually even building his own. He is one of the formost masters of firearms in existence, and when he
took on his patron, he was gifted a pair of very special revolvers. He used his gifted weapons to carry out his side of the bargain he made, the murder of his own wayward father and retreive his mother. His father had
taken his mother away from the family and turned her against their patron. Nicodeamus was charged with hunting him down, ending his life and returning his mother to his grandmother.  He did so with glee and with flourish.
Gunning the man down in cold blood, almost as an afterthought, after securing his mother and burning their home to the ground. Completing his assigned task, he granted significant power from his patron and has been
practicing his gifts ever since. As he reached his late 20's, his grandmothers growing frailty required him to step up and take over the day to day leadership of the family. With the help of his wife/sister Irini, he has
been a very successful leader, growing the family in size, power and influence.

									Nicodeamus Dumas is almost a caricature of a man. Tall and bone-thin with pale, freckled skin and wild curls of flaming red hair that he keeps tucked under a wide brimmed hat. He dresses like a dandy, with fine travelling
clothes, impeccibly pressed, usually in a purple or burgundy with white gloves. He almost always has a sly, almost quizzical smile plastered across his face and entrancing violet-colored eyes. He is perpetually whistling
a jaunty little tune but makes no effort to hide the sidearm on each hip under his long black coat, openly demonstrating to all that encounter him that he is always a threat. While coming off as jovial and cartoonish,
Nicodeamus is sharp as a tack and thoroughly vicious. His happy demeanor is primarily for the purposes of recruitment, but also partially because he's a little on the mad side. He is endearing and charming while things
are going his way, but like a true sociopath, can turn hard and cold at a moments notice. He is ruthless in persuit of his goals, but generally finds it easier to use the carrot rather than the stick to achieve his
aims. He likes to use either gambling or card tricks to break the ice with potential recruits and can be very persuasive when he wants to be. With the exception of his patron and his granmother, he will tolerate absolutley
no disrespect or disobedience from the other members of 'The Family' and will not hesitate to sacrifice anyone who invokes his ire.
