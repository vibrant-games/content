		<h3>Background</h3></div>
		<span>	<p><p>Thane hails from the brewing town of Hemmelweist [Village/Town] in remote hills nestled within the vast mountain range of SimmeredAshes [Mountain Range]. His community were very kinship focused and taught him the value of offering hearth and home to those people among whom one lives. Cared for by multiple different members of this closeknit community, he gained a deep love for the 'commoner' - he or she that partakes in those daily activities that support a group and form its foundational infrastructure. He thusly also learned the various skillsets that complement such a vision: brewing, cooking, textile work. Creating fabulous rare brews of mountain apples and deephops or lush woven fabrics for bed linens and window dressings; these were the lively activities that colored his youth.</p>However, these beautiful products were being created during a time when neighboring mountain Dwarven cities, such as Kindlebrough and Cynd [Dwarven cities], and various Human settlements in the Eastern Plains [Broad Settled Expanse] were suffering from hunger and poverty. This wondrous pallette of the best aspects of Dwarven culture was suddenly disrupted after a pact was struck upon between these two communities - a pact for mutual expansion. A collective response was required from Thane's tribe and an aristocracy quickly formed as the village leaders were overcome with panic and sudden greed. Quickly rising in power, this group condensed to a few self-appointed leaders. They became tyrants in a matter of months, enforcing impossible laws that led to austere and deprived conditions. Families were broken and scattered. Vowing to one day return and bring his people back to their glory, Thane fled for weeks searching for a civilization within which to begin his life anew and share the ethical codes of his people with the world at large.</p>Thane's inborn work ethic gained traction with village markets and it wasn't long before he had accrued enough coin to begin planning to return to his people. His connections to the people with whom he resettled excite him at the potential that he will not return to his home alone.</p>
