      &lt;p&gt;The Goliaths of Gond&#39;Qor are known as devout followers of Re, the God of Hooves and Horns [Any Central Goliath Deity]. These religious peoples promote strength and fortitude in their followers and advocate for supporting the strengths and good in others. Raised in this complex ritualistic community, Irtano developed a strong set of powers, abilities, and skills, and an even stronger set of ethics about how to treat himself and others. This also imbued him with high expectations as to how others ought to treat him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Order of Re have set missionary goals whereby they send accomplished acolytes out into the Realms to aid in building up the &#39;lesser-thans&#39; and promote their code of interconnected support. Irtano was selected as one such acolyte and sent forth to display his strength and abilities and to promote the Order&#39;s code of a Realm-wide brotherhood of strength and support.&lt;/p&gt;
