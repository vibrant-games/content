    <div class="background-story">
      Warsoc&#39;s father leads a powerful and especially brutal war party of orcs. With little stomach for the violence of his clan, he abandoned a raiding party in his young teens and made his way to town. He found that his tribe had lied and he wasn&#39;t immediately hated and feared for his heritage, In return, he decided he would defend his new home. When he came of age, he joined The Watch. He&#39;s a rookie and not very confident in his skills, smarts or anything else really, but his trainer and sergeant think he&#39;s slowly becoming a good watchman. He is loyal and earnest but not very assertive for an officer, but he&#39;s working on it. Since he was part of a war-band for most of his youth, he has developed an affinity for the children&#39;s toys he was denied as a child and has amassed quite a collection in his small barracks room
