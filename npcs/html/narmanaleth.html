									<p2>When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. You can use this trait immediately before or after you roll, but before any of the roll&#39;s effects occur.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Mental Discipline</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You have resistance to psychic damage</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Mind Link</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself. As a bonus action when you’re speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and be able to see you.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Psychic Glamour</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Choose one of the following skills - Insight, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion. You have advantage on all ability checks you make with that skill</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Severed from Dreams</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Kalashtar sleep, but they don’t connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to magical spells and effects that require you to dream, like the Dream spell, but not to spells and effects that put you to sleep, like the Sleep spell</p2><br>

									<p2>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you Forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would</p2><br>

							<p1><b>Spirit Sight</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

									<p2>You can connect with animal spirits and improve the demeanor of a creature with the beast type that you can see. Using your totem, you can use your action to attempt to make a target creature indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. Each beast creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate. You are able to perform this twice per short or long rest</p2><br>

							<p><b><h4></h4></b></p><p> </p>
									
									
									
										
							<p1><b>Spiritual Guide</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You are bestowed a spirit guide to help you progress further. The spirit guide takes on the incorporeal form of your totem spirit. Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your Spirit Guide appears by your side. The Spirit Guide is the embodiment of the Spirit World for you. It cannot be seen by anyone else by non-magical means, but it can see and hear others as you would. The Spirit guide communicates and interacts with the shaman as a conscious being. The spirit guide grants the shaman advantage to initiative rolls, can’t be surprised while conscious, and other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Ghost Touch</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Any weapon that you touch deals damage normally against any incorporeal creature regardless of its resistance to that damage type. This feature lasts as long as the shaman holds the weapon. The shaman also gains resistance to melee attacks from incorporeal creatures e.g. ghosts, shadows, wraiths, will-o’-wisp, specters</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Spiritual Focus</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can give the spirit guide the task of concentrating on a spell or spell-like ability that is maintained through concentration. The shaman can act normally while his spirit guide concentrates on the spell. If the shaman casts another spell that requires concentration, then the first spell effect ends and the second spell begins. The shaman can choose the spirit guide to concentrate on any subsequent spells cast. A spirit guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. A spirit guide does not have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such as the shaman taking damage. The spirit guide is not present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact. If the shaman falls unconscious or dies, then the spirit guide stops concentrating on the spell, and the spell’s effect ends.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Spirit Journey</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>A spirit shaman knows how to vanish bodily into the Spirit World. As an Action, a shaman can become incorporeal and move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes 1d10 force damage if he ends his turn inside an object. While incorporeal, the shaman does not invoke attacks of opportunity. Outside of combat, the shaman can spend time in prayer and meditation to commune directly with other spirits in the Spirit World to attempt receive information concerning their current quest. The shaman can ask three questions that can be answers with a yes or no. While in meditation, the shaman’s soul is in the Spirit World, and cannot communicate with others in the Natural world</p2><br>

							<p1><b>Staff of the Woodlands</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell Attack Rolls. The staff has 10 Charges for the following Properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its Properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Spells - You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff&#39;s Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC - Animal Friendship (1 charge), Awaken (5 charges), Barkskin (2 charges), Locate Animals or Plants (2 charges), Speak with Animals (1 charge), Speak with Plants (3 charges), or Wall of Thorns (6 charges). You can also use an action to cast the Pass without Trace spell from the staff without using any Charges.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Tree Form - You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic if targeted by Detect Magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its Command, word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Statue of Wondrous Power</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Silver Crow - Transformed into a raven for 24 hours a week</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful. It predates the establishment of any church. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven—or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana&#39;s passing. The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center. The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Hold Vampires - As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and vampire spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Turn Undead - If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Sunlight - As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required).</p2><br>

									After coming of age in Adar and seeing the threats posed by the Dreaming Dark and the Riedra, Narmanaleth fled out into the world to hide, fight back and follow the path of a shaman. Using his Quori spirit to help him
connect with other spirits of other realms, he became very adept and after years of practicing, very powerful in his chosen path. He speaks with and for the spirits. In addition to using his power to combat the forces of
the Dreaming Dark on the astral plane, he will also seek out heroes and adventurers to help them find their path at the spirit's behest. He is very old and very tired now, his battle is almost done and he's looking for
those who would follow in his footsteps to impart his knowledge. Like most of his kind, he has bouts of madness caused by his twin spirit, but they are much fewer and further between as he's gotten older.
