    <div class="background-story">
      After coming of age in Adar and seeing the threats posed by the Dreaming Dark and the Riedra, Narmanaleth fled out into the world to hide, fight back and follow the path of a shaman. Using his Quori spirit to help him connect with other spirits of other realms, he became very adept and after years of practicing, very powerful in his chosen path. He speaks with and for the spirits. In addition to using his power to combat the forces of the Dreaming Dark on the astral plane, he will also seek out heroes and adventurers to help them find their path at the spirit&#39;s behest. He is very old and very tired now, his battle is almost done and he&#39;s looking for those who would follow in his footsteps to impart his knowledge. Like most of his kind, he has bouts of madness caused by his twin spirit, but they are much fewer and further between as he&#39;s gotten older.
