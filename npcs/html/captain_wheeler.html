    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;A largely forgotten child of a wealthy Dragonborn family nearly obliterated by discriminating Elven and Human armies, Captain Wheeler became something of a man-whore chasing females for personal validation. In these seedy social circles, he connected with the Violet Conch, a high-sea slaver group who traded in peoples of any race or social class so long as it was profitable. Realizing his opportunity at wealth (and not caring that others would suffer) Captain Wheeler trained with the Violet Conch, learning the &#39;ropes&#39; of sailing and trading peoples as goods. The process largely wore down his moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of these heavy experiences, Wheeler (renamed by his sailmates - his original name only known to him at this point) is well known as the &#39;beast who inspires&#39; or the &#39;spirit of the wandering sailor&#39; because of his profound fecundity with respect to sea-shanties. Those shanties have become even more renown because of their magical effects - often saving sailors and their ships in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
