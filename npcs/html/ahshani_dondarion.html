    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Ahshani came from a small but noble house from a distant continent [any with PanAsian historical flare].  He trained from a young age in the way of the samurai and according to his master was destined to be the greatest of his time. As a teen, he fell in love with a local serving girl, much below his station. Forbidden by his house to see her, he continued to sneak out to spend time with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night while he was clandestinely in his lovers arms, his master was assassinated and his house was murdered. Blaming himself, Ahshani gathered his armor and his master&#39;s blade and left his home, becoming a ronin. Swearing to fight against evil wherever he finds it, all the while searching for the answers to who murdered his family their motivations for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
