							<p1><b>Combat Superiority</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Maneuvers - You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Ambush - When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren&#39;t incapacitated.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Bait and Switch - When you&#39;re within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn&#39;t incapacitated. This movement doesn&#39;t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Brace - When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you&#39;re wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon&#39;s damage roll.</p2><br>
