									<p2>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a long rest</p2><br>

									<p2>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature&#39;s speed is 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the creature&#39;s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p2><br>

									<p2>You gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this Magic Weapon. When you hit a fiend or an Undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage. While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all Creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on Saving Throws against Spells and other magical Effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the Paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Blood-Sword</b></p1><br>

You gain a +3 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Does regular great sword damage, which is 2d6. It has the following additional properties</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Bloodthirsty - The sword does not care what the owner does, but if it has gone a long time without a taste of blood the sword may, at the GM’s discretion, become warm and bloodthirsty, it will try and compel it’s owner to slay someone as soon as possible. If the owner does not comply it will try and take control of him. If the sword takes control of the owner he can make a DC 11 charisma saving throw to stop the sword from killing the next person it sees. The GM can keep asking this until the player fails or lets the sword do the deed.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Blood Absorber - The sword can absorb blood and use it for different abilities. To absorb blood you have to wound an opponent that bleeds red 3 times to get enough blood. You can also spend an action to absorb blood on the ground if someone has been bloodied there. The blood remains in the sword until used.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Control Undead - As an action the sword owner can use the blood in the sword to attempt to take control of an undead within 30 ft of it. The target must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the sword owner for 24 hours, or until the sword owner releases him. The sword can attempt to personally take control of the undead, to do so it has to make a wisdom throw against the sword owner. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the sword owner is immune. When the blood as been spent it will release the blood it recently absorbed and will not be able to absorb more blood for an hour.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Inflict wound - The sword owner can use it’s action to command the sword to use blood wound to do an extra 2d10 damage with his normal attack if he hits. When used it will release the blood it recently absorbed and will not be able to absorb more blood for 1 hour.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Blood consumer - You can spend a bonus action to consume the blood from the sword in your hand and heal yourself for your constitution modifier times 10. After the blood has been consumed it will release whatever blood is remaining and will not be able to absorb more blood for an hour.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Golden Plate Male</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>this formerly glorious armor is now dirty, dented, blood-caked and black-spotted. Because of this it&#39;s protection has dropped from a +3 to a +2</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While wearing it, you have an extra +2 bonus to your AC, and your speed increases by 10 feet.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>This armor has 5 charges. It regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you roll a Dexterity saving throw or you roll for initiative, you can expend 1 charge to gain advantage on that roll before you make it.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges and halve the damage you take from that attack, unless the damage is necrotic.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>If you fail a saving throw, you can expend 4 charges to succeed instead.</p2><br>

									Nothuriel was a great leader of the King's Army. Rising up through the ranks along side of her beloved husband Gerrard Romkey. Their bond of love provided each other with strength and resolve. The two had waded into many
a battle and conquored many a foe in the name their god, king and country, becoming regaled heroes of the realm. All until the last battle. Nothuriel had secretly heard dark voices in her head since childhood. Those voices
had lead her to find and take a cursed blade called the Blood-Sword. In the pitch of battle, the Blood-Sword caused Nothuriel to lose control. Mid-battle she turned and impaled her love, the Blood-Sword absorbing his blood
and soul preventing any magical healing from reviving him and restoring his life. Fiding that the army's healers, doctors and clerics could not restore Gerrard, she immediately walked away and went on a quest to find 
someone or something that could. Since then she has wandered the earth, searching ancient texts and ruins and temples to find a way to bring him back. She has also sworn to find and reek vengeance against the cause of 
the voices in her head

She will absolutely not be curved or distracted from her mission. She will do her best to walk away from confrontation, but if pressed will bring to bear all of her considerable martial prowess.
