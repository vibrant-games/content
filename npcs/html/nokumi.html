									Sylvan Elves aren't limited to a certain locale. In fact, being animistic, many tribes have aligned themselves with particular facets of the wild. Nokumi's tribe, self-entitled that Nation of Nac Mac, have settled
throughout the tributaries and banks of the great Thaad River [Any Grand River] and exemplify how the spirituality of the Sylvan Elves has diversified and refined itself to various aspects of the wilderness. They are a
nomadic peoples whose patterns resemble that of a tiger around these flowing fingers of water. They draw their shamanic energies and histories of lore from the ecology and happenings that constitute the rapids and still
bodies that make up the area. Although their culture focuses on these waters, their knowledge of nature and the region is far from limited by it. They are expert guides and trackers. Nokumi is no exception. She can
lead most travelers to almost anywhere in the region through easy or difficult terrain, often showing her patrons short cuts or means of survival. Her entourage of pets are more akin to friends who follow her in return for
her love and kindness. They are all almost attuned to one another as an arcane caster might be attuned to her familiar. Eschewing most material wealth, as is custom for her peoples, Nokumi will often only accept tools
or clothing in return for her guidance.
