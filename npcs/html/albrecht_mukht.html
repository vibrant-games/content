			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			
				<br /><span>Often encountered while working a contracting job on a home or business, such as a tavern or inn. Performing some roofing or general repairs he may shout out to ask a party to pitch-in for some gold in return. May also approach sinister looking adventurers with an offer to &#39;free the land&#39; from the vile clutches of humans or some other race and ask him/her to &#39;off&#39; a few members of said race.</span>
				
		</div>
		
		<div class="property-line">
	<h4>Appearance</h4>
		<br />	Stout and muscular - barrel shaped; 5&#39;5&quot;; Tanned reddish brown skin; Deep brown dreadlocks with blonde highlights; various scars on his body and one across his right eye;
		</div>
		
		<div class="property-line">
			<h4>Expressions</h4>
		<br />	 &quot;If you gots a need, I do the deed&quot;; &quot;(Glancing around at the buildings) Poor craftsmanship. Damned (elves/humans) couldn&#39;t build quality if they tried&quot;; &quot;Each of you need to learn discipline. Take up a good trade. This ugly place needs better tradesmen&quot;; &quot;Those damned elves are full of pigshit. We&#39;ll get rid of &#39;em eventually&quot;; &quot;Petty humans and their politics. I say, kill &#39;em all. They&#39;re all the same&quot;;
		</div> 
		
		<div class="property-line">
			<h4>Mannerisms</h4>
		<br />	Speaks in something of a low growl; Easily distracted; Will forego tasks to complete a puzzle; carries small wooden sliding puzzles he built wherever he goes and uses them to answer to problems he&#39;s facing; always pointing out the differences between the races yet can&#39;t tell the difference between members of the same race.
		</div> 
		
		<div class="property-line">
			<h4>Motivations</h4>
		<br />	A paradoxically deeply racist multi-racial individual, Albrecht experiences his greatest joy when human or elven populations are diminished in numbers. He is also highly driven to have a hand in as many building projects in his current town or city so he can brag about his renown.

		</div> 
		
			
			<div class="property-line">
			<h4>Passions</h4>
		<br />	Woodworking; puzzles; racism

		<h3>Background</h3></div>
		<span>	<p><p>Brushing his dreadlocks from his eyes, Albrecht stares down the elves approaching his work site. </p><p><i>"Oy, git yer dirty feet off this site! Yer gonna taint the beauty of my work!" </i>He snarls, spitting in their direction.</p><p> The two elves remark to each other about the rarity they see nailing shingles to the roof of the new tavern. A half-orc? A feral dwarf? They cannot be certain. His muscular body and scars tell a story of a man who is not civilized, per se. A man who would unleash rage upon them. The elves depart.</p><p>The progeny of a Dwarven slave woman who answered to Orcish slavers in a barbaric tribe, Albrecht had no true connection to family, as one might know it, except to hate others and unleash rage upon those who challenge him.</p><p> Tired of the poor and sloppy indulgences of his tribe, Albrecht sought greater wealth and power. He followed a trading caravan he saw passing in the distance of the plains, offering to help them with any repairs or services they might need. He continued on with this 'hired-hand' type business upon arriving in the town of Meership Downs, a small sailing port and bustling sea-side community. Here he grew his talents, but also his hatred for other races as the village was frequented by many types of people carousing, drinking, fighting, and all-around ne'er-do-wells. Now, Albrecht focuses on having his 'stamp' on as many buildings, ships, wagons, and so forth, as he possibly can. He puts his anger and hatred into his work knowing that unleashing his rage would not only be dangerous for others, but most certainly for himself.</p>
