    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Brushing his dreadlocks from his eyes, Albrecht stares down the elves approaching his work site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Oy, git yer dirty feet off this site! Yer gonna taint the beauty of my work!&quot; &lt;/i&gt;He snarls, spitting in their direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two elves remark to each other about the rarity they see nailing shingles to the roof of the new tavern. A half-orc? A feral dwarf? They cannot be certain. His muscular body and scars tell a story of a man who is not civilized, per se. A man who would unleash rage upon them. The elves depart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progeny of a Dwarven slave woman who answered to Orcish slavers in a barbaric tribe, Albrecht had no true connection to family, as one might know it, except to hate others and unleash rage upon those who challenge him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tired of the poor and sloppy indulgences of his tribe, Albrecht sought greater wealth and power. He followed a trading caravan he saw passing in the distance of the plains, offering to help them with any repairs or services they might need. He continued on with this &#39;hired-hand&#39; type business upon arriving in the town of Meership Downs, a small sailing port and bustling sea-side community. Here he grew his talents, but also his hatred for other races as the village was frequented by many types of people carousing, drinking, fighting, and all-around ne&#39;er-do-wells. Now, Albrecht focuses on having his &#39;stamp&#39; on as many buildings, ships, wagons, and so forth, as he possibly can. He puts his anger and hatred into his work knowing that unleashing his rage would not only be dangerous for others, but most certainly for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
