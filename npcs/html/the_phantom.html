									<p2>As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&#39;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&#39;t take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there&#39;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Destroy Undead</b></p1><br>

							<p1><b>Divine Intervention</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity&#39;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can&#39;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p2><br>

									<p2>You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. In addition, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn&#39;t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.

									<p2>You gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn&#39;t behind total cover and that isn&#39;t protected from divination magic. This sense doesn&#39;t tell you anything about a creature&#39;s capabilities or identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once).

									<p2>You can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack&#39;s damage, and then the curse ends.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Sentinel at Deaths Door</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Potent Spellcasting</b></p1><br>

							<p1><b>Keeper of Souls</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren&#39;t incapacitated. Once you use it, you can&#39;t do so again until the start of your next turn.</p2><br>

Before the start of your next turn, you can shoot this arrow in place of a normal attack. You do not make an attack roll with this arrow. Instead, all creatures in a 5-foot-wide line extending from you to the longest range of your weapon must succeed on a DC 19 saving throw or take 2d10 piercing damage and 10d10 radiant damage. If there is only one creature in this line and it is within your weapon&#39;s normal range, that creature has disadvantage on this saving throw.

Long Reach - The champion&#39;s lance has an increased reach of 10 feet. But, due to its massive size, you can only attack with this lance once per turn. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Champion&#39;s Flurry - If the attuned wielder of the champion lance has an extra attack feature, they add an additional 1d12 damage to the lance&#39;s damage rolls for each number of additional attacks they can make. So, a 5th level fighter can add a 1d12 to the champion lance&#39;s damage, whereas an 11th level fighter can add 2d12. Single Striker - Once the lance makes a successful attack, the tip breaks off and all subsequent attacks made with the lance are at a disadvantage. The lance regrows its potency after the course of a long rest. Riding Shift - If you successfully hit a creature with the lance while mounted, you may use your bonus action to move on your mount a distance up to half your mount&#39;s speed in any direction without provoking opportunity attacks.</p2><br>

									<p2>This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from The Helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, The Helm loses its magic. You gain the following benefits while wearing it You can use an action to cast one of the following Spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm&#39;s gems of the specified type as a component - Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from The Helm. As long as it has at least one Diamond, The Helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one Undead is within that area. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. As long as The Helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to fire damage. As long as The Helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a Command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an Attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a Bonus Action to speak the Command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon. Roll a d20 if you are wearing The Helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, The Helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of The Helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in The Helm. The Helm and its gems are then destroyed.</p2><br>

									The Phantom was once a priest named Adrenthis of Yanto. He specialized in hunting and tracking fiends and the undead. Unfortunately for him, he ran afoul of a Banelich, far beyond his ability to combat and was slain. 
Fortunately for him, the gods of good saw him as a useful tool and returned him to a semblance of life. He bacame a revenant tasked with hunting down the being that killed him. He has run up against the Banelich several
times, coming up short each time. In his continued quest to destroy his killer, he founded a clandestine organization of sort that he calls The Dead Hunters. In between attempts on the Banelich that haunts him, he and 
his group have continued on wih his previous calling of ridding the world of fiends and undead abominations. They work out of a small private abbey in the foothills and but are able to travel quickly throughout the 
continent via both mounts, vehicle or if speed is of the essence, teleportation.

									The Phantom is tall and broad Dragonborn. Decended from an Ancient Crystal Dragon. He sports a layer of crystaline scales over his body and his reptilian head including his frills and crest ropey hair.  His eyes are a 
cool platinum and clearly filled with wisdom. He wears full gleaming plate armor with shield and jewel covered helmet. He rides into battle on his massive white warhorse Arthon, who is similarly armored to his master. 
He is extremely dedicated to the path of peace and redemption and the destruction of those who are unredeemable. After his death and ressurection, he no longer felt quite like himself, and exchanged his name for a new 
one for his new life, The Phantom. He is beyond calm, cool and collected in life and in battle. He inspires his troops with his sheer force of will. He is selfless and willingly puts himself into harm's way to protect 
his companions and innocents. His is a battle that has been going on for a long long time, roughly 200 years, and hes very tired. He's tired of the chase. He's tired of watching his loved ones grow old and die. He's 
just tired. But he knows he will not be allowed to move on to his final reward until he destroys the evil that made him this way.
