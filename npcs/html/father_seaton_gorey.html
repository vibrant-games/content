							<p1><b>Dead Immortality</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You do not age. Given time, the necromantic energies that sustain you will heal most wounds you take at approximately the same rate as a mortal, and your hit dice function as normal.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Undead</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Raised from the dead as a being of undeath, you count as an undead creature for all spells and abilities that affect the undead. You are immune to disease and treat exhaustion as if it was one level less. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Darkvision</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Relentless Nature</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Regains 1HP at the beginning of each turn if below half maximum HP</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Unnatural Vitality</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>If you die, you returns to life 24hrs after death. If your body is destroyed you will reform within 1 mile of where you was killed. Equipment destroyed is not regained</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Eternal Vengeance</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At all times, you know the distance and direction between you and the creature involved in your goal unless they are on another plane</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Poison Resilience</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p2><br>

									<p2>As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&#39;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&#39;t take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving.

Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can&#39;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p2><br>

									<p2>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them. The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities.

									<p2>you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one Blood Curse of your choice. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse. You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>

									<p2>You learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list to learn. As a bonus action, you activate a crimson rite on a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite, you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active rite at a time. You learn an additional Primal Rite of your choice at 7th level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14th level.</p2><br>

									<p2>Whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 damage). Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Grim Psychometry</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and sometimes conveys visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Dark Augmentation</b></p1><br>

									<p2>The psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane shift fails.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Hardened Soul</b></p1><br>

							<p1><b>Sanguine Mastery</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.</p2><br>

The cleric can maintain concentration on this bond for up to one hour. While the bond is maintained, the cleric can spend an action to force the target creature to make a Constitution saving throw. If they succeed, the bond ends. If the creature fails, the cleric can see through the target&#39;s eyes or hear through the target&#39;s ears instead of the cleric&#39;s own for a number of rounds equal to the cleric&#39;s Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 round), after which the bond ends.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you attack a creature&#39;s astral body (that is, the creature is under the effect of the astral projection spell or similar magic) and the attack was a critical hit, you sever that creature&#39;s astral cord.</p2><br>

									<p2>While you wear this cloak, it projects an Illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual Location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on Attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are Incapacitated, Restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Rod of Absorption</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell&#39;s effect is canceled, and the spell&#39;s energy, not the spell itself is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can&#39;t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can&#39;t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot</p2><br>

							<p1><b>Ring of Mind Shielding</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other Creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your Alignment, or know your Creature Type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use an action to cause the ring to become Invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for The Afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can&#39;t prevent this Telepathic Communication.</p2><br>

									Grey Crow was once the shaman of her primitive tribe. During one of her journey's into the astral plane to speak with the spirits, she was touched by the Forbidden Gods. Their touch corrupted her spirit and her mind, 
leaving her their emmisary, walking the earth and sewing chaos in her wake. She returned to her body a corrupted being, and immediately proceeded to slaughter her tribe. Since then, she has walked the earth, doing the
bidding of her masters, preparing the world for their return. Somewhere along the line, she came into posession of a silver dagger forged by the Githyanki and capale of severing astral cords.

									Grey Crow is an exceedingly cunning liar and trickster. She is completely mad and derranged, but hides it well when it suits her needs. Her favorite game is to approach strangers out of the night, joining their campfire
as an elderly traveller on her own seeking shelter and companionship. She will then turn their secrets against them and use them to steer adventureres from their path. She likes to play tricks and jokes that cause as much 
choas as possible and uses her shapeshifting abilities to cause as much confusion and mistrust as possible with parties. She will rarely venture into large towns or cities, prefering to stick to the wilds. One of her
favorite tricks is convincing adventureres to travel with her to the Astral Plane with her, then using her silver dagger to sever their astral cord, leaving her victims dead and unrevivable.
