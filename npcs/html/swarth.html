    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Swarth was born large to large parents. His mother&#39;s breasts would have firehosed a more delicate babe, and his father&#39;s flatulence alone could knock out a vast forest filled with yellow canaries. Both parents were chefs, and both died of diabetes when Swarth was in his teens.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then he had acquired talents for curing and preparing meats, to a level that his parents had never quite achieved. While desserts were his father&#39;s specialties, and potato dishes his mother&#39;s, Swarth prepared liver pastes and deep fried pseudodragons like no other. He worked his way up slowly, from cook to sous-chef to chef, often replacing his predecessor by virtue of fearsomeness and a frighteningly sharp cleaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He owns the tavern where he is now barkeep and head chef, having spent half a lifetime (and several subordinates) there.  Two pale spotty boys help out with the cooking and food preparation during busy hours, and the waitress roles are filled from a revolving door pf ladies of all ages, shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swarth&#39;s food comprises layers of various types of meat, exquisitely arranged, often with a liver paste &quot;S&quot; signature on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent bar mitzvah catered by Swarth, Flee -- whether deliberately or accidentally -- slapped Swarth in the face with a chain.  Ever since, Swarth has been trying to find Flee.  He does not know what punishment lies in store for Flee, only that face is important to be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
