									<p2>Your knowledge of Death gives you heightened awareness of other creatures of Death. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Undead and Fiends, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p2><br>

							<p1><b>Rune Weapon</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 2nd level, you can draw on the dread magic of the grave to inscribe your weapon with deathly Runes. These Runes may be used for additional effects described in this class description. You must spend one hour inscribing your weapon, which may be completed during a short rest. You may inscribe up to two weapons, and you cannot be disarmed of your Rune Weapons while you are conscious. If you inscribe a third weapon, you must choose one of your previous two weapons from which to remove the Runes.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You have 4 total Runes, and you gain Runes as indicated in the Class Table. You recover all expended Runes when you finish a short or long rest. If an ability that uses a Rune requires a saving throw, the saving throw DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. No Rune features require a spell attack roll.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Rune Strike</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Beginning at 2nd level, when you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, you may expend a Rune to add an additional effect to the attack, as listed below.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Rejuvenating Strike - You channel what’s left of your divine blessing into your weapon strike. If your attack hits, you may expend 1 Rune to cause the attack to deal Radiant damage, and heal you for half the damage dealt (rounded down). You can only regain HP if the blow is struck in combat. At 5th level, you may add your Constitution modifier to the healing, twice your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and 3 times your Constitution modifier at 17th level.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Icy Blast - If your attack hits, the target takes the normal attack damage, and you may expend 1 Rune to deal 1d6 extra Cold damage and force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has its speed halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target does not have its speed reduced. The damage increases by 1d6 at 5th (2d6), 11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Plague Strike - If your attack hits, the target takes the normal attack damage, and you may expend 1 Rune to deal 1d6 additional Necrotic damage and afflict the target with Plague for 1 minute. At the beginning of its next turn, and at the beginning of each of its turns thereafter, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 Necrotic damage from the plague. On a successful save, the effect ends. The Plague effect does not stack if applied more than once. The strike and plague damage increases by 1d6 at 5th (2d6), 11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Grim Oath</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 3rd level you mimic the Oath you took in your former life. Though you can choose to follow the same Tenets, you are not bound by your Paladin Oath any longer, and may do as you please. Choose a Grim Oath that you follow exclusively. You may choose the Oath of the Undying, Oath of the North, or Oath of the Plague, all detailed at the end of this class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th lel.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Oath of Undying - Undying Presence - At 3rd level when you take this Oath, your blood churns with radiant fire. You gain resistance to Radiant damage. Additionally, the target of your Rejuvenating Strike has disadvantage on attacks against targets other than you until the end of its next turn. Aura of the Undying - At 7th level, allies within 10 feet of you gain resistance to Radiant damage. Additionally, the power of your radiant blood can help prevent death. You and allies within 10 feet of you gain advantage on Death Saving Throws. The power of your will is so strong, the saving throw effect persists even if you are unconscious or incapacitated. At 18th level, this Aura increases to 30 feet. Radiant Blood - Upon reaching 9th level, the radiant fire of life infuses your soul. Your blood becomes radiant fire. If you are cut and bleeding, the radiance of your blood causes no damage, but you may use a bonus action to use your blood for lighting a candle, campfire, or another similar use. A fire lit in this manner is considered non-magical and burns a shade of radiant yellow instead of the normal color of fire Improved Rejuvenating Strike - At 15th level, when you use Rejuvenating Strike, you may spend up to 3 additional Runes. For each additional Rune spent, the healing increases by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier. Purgatory - By 20th level, your radiant vitality allows you to refuse to die. When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, but not killed outright, your soul may keep fighting in your stead. Your soul has the same speed, hit points, and ability scores as your body, AC 20, and deals magical slashing damage equal 1d10 + your strength modifier. Your soul cannot take any action other than the attack, disengage, dodge, or help action, and cannot use any Rune Strikes. If your Soul is reduced to 0 hit points, or moves more than 100 feet from your body, you die immediately and cannot be resurrected by any means. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you succeed on 3 death saving throws, and you must finish a long rest before you can benefit from it again. You make your death saving throws at the end of your turn during Purgatory.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Lingering Radiance</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 3rd level, the small spark of radiance from your former life manifests. You are immune to disease.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Extra Attack</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Aura of Dread</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 6th level, your presence hangs heavily on your enemies. Whenever an enemy within 10 feet must make a saving throw, it takes a penalty on the throw equal to 1 + half your Wisdom modifier, rounded down. This Aura does not stack with itself or similar effects (such as the Bane spell). At 18th level, this Aura increases to 30 feet.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Dreadful Visage</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Upon reaching 6th level, your connection to Death allows you to temporarily alter your body slightly. As an action, choose one of the following options. The effect lasts for one hour, or until you use another action to end it.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Visage of Fear - You may use the power of Death to temporarily twist your face and body into a horrific sight. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Visage of Grace - You may use the power of Death to temporarily heal the scars of your previous death, making you more acceptable among those who have not experienced Death. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Relentless Advance</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 9th level, you become as relentless as Death itself. Your speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, non-magical difficult terrain does not reduce your speed.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Pull of the Grave</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 10th level, your power over the forces of Death increase. As an action, you may spend 1 Rune to cause a target within 30 feet of you that you can see to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled up to 30 feet towards you. If the target is pulled within melee range of you, you may make one weapon attack against it as a bonus action.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Speak with Undead</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>By 11th level, your knowledge of the inner workings of Death allows you to communicate with the dead. You may expend 1 Rune to cast the Speak with Dead spell. However, you may also target any undead creature using this spell.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Magic Barrier</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 13th level, you can harness the power of death to protect yourself against offensive magic. As a reaction when a spell is cast that targets you or an area you’re in, you may spend 1 Rune to create a barrier around yourself, granting you resistance to the damage dealt by spells until the beginning of your next turn.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Raise Dead</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 14th level, your connection with death allows you to expend power to help others return from Death. You may spend 4 Runes to cast the Raise Dead spell without requiring material components. You may do this only once per long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Death’s Endurance</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>By 17th level, your connection to Death empowers you, giving you the ability to trudge onward when others would fall. You are immune to Exhaustion. Additionally, when you are the victim of a critical hit, you may use your reaction to turn it into a normal hit. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier, and regain spent uses upon completing a long rest.</p2><br>
