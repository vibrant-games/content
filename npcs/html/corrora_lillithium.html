        Story
      </a>
    </div>

    <div class="background-story">
      The son of Yakahe&#39;s human ambassador to the High-Elves of Silverleaf and a Elven diplomat, Corrora had it all as a child and young man. Intelligent and athletic, he excelled on the training field and under the tutelage of the local sages who taught the children of minor Nobles in his home; the city of Baraithton.&lt;/p&gt;
|
&lt;p&gt;As an adolescent, Corrora began to have extremely vivid nightmares of himself committing terrible, violent acts. The nightmares progressed to the point where the previously gregarious nobleman&#39;s son turned sullen and dour. The lack of sleep caused him to be irritable, constantly snapping at his family, his tutors, and his friends. The feeling of isolation only made the problem worse. The nightmares because more violent, more vivid, and more frequent the more withdrawn he became. 
|
One day the nightmares became reality. A skirmish with his younger brother, Yarith ended in bloodshed. While wrestling, Corrora blacked out. When he came to his senses, he was holding a sharpened shard of rock with his Yarith&#39;s blood dripping from it and his brother&#39;s limp body beneath him. Dropping the stone in horror, Corrora was touched by the Goddess Lenterra (Goddess of arcane knowledge) for the first time. He could feel her hand reaching through him as he cradled his Yarith&#39;s head in his lap. A soft glowing light encompassed them both. And, Yarith breathed.&lt;/p&gt;
|
&lt;p&gt;That night, and for several nights after, Corrora had the same dream: he was floating above his body watching as his eyes became red with a hint of flickering fire followed by him reaching for a rock and slashing Yarith&#39;s throat with it.&lt;/p&gt;
|
&lt;p&gt;This was not the last time something like this happened to Corrora.&lt;/p&gt;
|
&lt;p&gt;At the suggestion of Lenterra, Corrora began to deepen his study of the arcane and religion in search of a cure for his condition. His natural curiosity lent itself to him becoming a renowned expert in arcane and ancient religious phenomenon. This research led him to discover that the Elvish side of his heritage held some deep ancient secrets. A number of his ancestors had committed despicable acts millenia ago. The acts they committed were the very acts he dreams about so vividly. The ancestors were the very ancestors who&#39;s spirits overcame his body when under too much stress from imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
|
&lt;p&gt;Corrora is constantly in search of a way to rid himself from his ancestor&#39;s curse. This search is what originally brought him to Eberston and the Yakahe frontier far from his family. &lt;/p&gt;
