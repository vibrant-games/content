										Broken Pocket Watch.  Wondrous item, very rare, requires attunement.  It’s rare to find a pocket watch at all outside of gnomish settlements. This one seems to be broken as it sometimes skips back a few seconds. It holds great power for the one who attunes it, though. The broken pocket watch has 3 charges. On your turn, you can spend 1 charge to take an additional bonus action, as the pocket watch ticks back by two seconds to give you another moment for something quick. The pocket watch regains 1 expended charge at dawn.  Alternately, you can force it to turn backward as far as it can go. This does not require an action and takes 3 charges. You can’t do this if you are incapacitated. You teleport to any location you have been earlier in this turn, you regain any hit points you have lost since the beginning of your turn, and you can immediately take another turn. The pocket watch falls apart after that, and require 1 week of specialized repairs. If this last ability is chosen, after 1 minute, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

										Dagger of Warning.  Most rogues shouldn&#39;t really need help with their perception, but this dagger helps both the rogue and everyone around them. While attuned, the rogue can&#39;t be surprised and are magically awoken from their sleep when danger approaches—along with all allies within 30 feet of them. Not to mention the dagger gives the rogue advantage on initiative rolls, which is a valuable thing for them to have.
