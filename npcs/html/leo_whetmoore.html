     <ul>
          <li>
            <span > Broken Pocket Watch.  Wondrous item, very rare, requires attunement.  It’s rare to find a pocket watch at all outside of gnomish settlements. This one seems to be broken as it sometimes skips back a few seconds. It holds great power for the one who attunes it, though. The broken pocket watch has 3 charges. On your turn, you can spend 1 charge to take an additional bonus action, as the pocket watch ticks back by two seconds to give you another moment for something quick. The pocket watch regains 1 expended charge at dawn.  Alternately, you can force it to turn backward as far as it can go. This does not require an action and takes 3 charges. You can’t do this if you are incapacitated. You teleport to any location you have been earlier in this turn, you regain any hit points you have lost since the beginning of your turn, and you can immediately take another turn. The pocket watch falls apart after that, and require 1 week of specialized repairs. If this last ability is chosen, after 1 minute, you suffer one level of exhaustion. </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span > Dagger of Warning.  Most rogues shouldn&#39;t really need help with their perception, but this dagger helps both the rogue and everyone around them. While attuned, the rogue can&#39;t be surprised and are magically awoken from their sleep when danger approaches—along with all allies within 30 feet of them. Not to mention the dagger gives the rogue advantage on initiative rolls, which is a valuable thing for them to have. </span>

			<h3>Combat Tactics</h3>
			<p>Leo is no coward. He will, however, try to avoid or escape combat because of his belief that his worth as leader of the Lythiad assembly is more important than proving his mettle in a single battle.

		<h3>Background</h3></div>
		<span>	<p><p>The <i>Lion's Mane Tavern</i> is a charming local destination location. Well-kept with superb staff, it has a firm grip on the business of the community and its proprietor, Leo, has their respect.</p><p>Leo's tavern is more than a reputable destination location, it is also the center for his organized crime syndicate, the Lythiad Assembly. Composed primarily of Leo's extended family but including myriad community officials and mercants, the Assembly doesn't perform what Leo calls, 'Brutish Outlaw' work, but instead is highly surgical in their activities. Kidnapping, smuggling, and political terrorism are the Assembly's professional province.</p><p>Leo and his two brothers and one sister are carrying on the business of their father and uncles. Just how long the Assembly has been operating remains lore lost in history. Leo claims they've operated for centuries and span well-beyond the region. While there are some facts to corroborate this (and the local militia are certainly investigating), the evidence for this is lacking.</p>
