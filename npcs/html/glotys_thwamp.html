											<h3>Introduction</h3>
							
							</span>
										
											<span class="right-line">
										<p>Glotys loves to spread word of the quality of her honey products. She keeps busy throughout the market place selling her edible honeys in the forms of jarred honeys, jellies, crystals, and so forth, partnering with bakers, chefs, and candymakers. Glotys is seeking rare flowers to plant within her aviary range to produce even more formidable honeys.</p>
		
						
										</span>
		
		
										<span class="right-line">
			
											<h3>Appearance</h3>
										Relatively lean and gaunt for a dwarf; tangled black curls and chin beard; wears firm leather beekeeping uniforms at nearly all times; bright green eyes; Always wears fresh flowers in her hair
		
										</span>
		
		
										<span class="right-line">
			
											<h3>Expressions</h3>
											
											 &quot;Can&#39;t make honey without getting stung!&quot;; &quot;My money is on the little things that make the world what it is. Bugs, crawlies, moss, and pebbles&quot;; &quot;Keep me outta the loop. I got tons to do already!&quot;; &quot;Bugs are far more organized than most peoples&quot;;
		
										</span> 
		
		
										<span class="right-line">
			
											<h3>Mannerisms</h3>
											
											Often scratching herself or applying ointments to bee stings. When she smiles or laughs, which is often, Glotys covers her mouth childishly.
		
										</span> 
		
		
										<span class="right-line">
			
											<h3>Motivations</h3>
										
											Glotys is driven to discover new and exotic flora for her bees to pollinate and thus make different honies. She is also quietly motivated to quell the conflicts between races. She&#39;s convinced herself that the answer is &#39;Honey&#39;.

								&lt;p&gt;Glotys had a simple and genuine upbringing by a Dwarven family in love with the wilderness. They lived in a small village on the outskirts of the great hill Dwarf Empire of Ualen [any major Dwarven Empire] renown for their generosity in supplying the rest of the realm with forged goods, gems, and precious ores. Her peoples&#39; passion for what wealth and goods lay within the hills did not appeal to her. Instead, Glotys took a liking to the nature above ground. The blooming of flowers and how their pollenation by bees rejeuvenated the life that flourished above ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her passion for bees was so profound that as she learned more and more about the ecology of her surroundings the busy little insects were drawn to her. Her hard work and staunch dedication to learning more of her surroundings were rewarded with certain magicks that enable her to communicate with the tiny pollenators and call on them for help. These moments inspired her to begin an endeavour to provide housing and even greater love and support to these important components of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
