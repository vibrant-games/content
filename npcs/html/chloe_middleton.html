Both of her parents were political advisors and urged Chloe into the same vocation but Chloe was rebellious in her youth, causing all kinds of trouble with local merchants and incoming adventurers. She was particularly notorious for getting so drunk on cherry or apple wine that her teeth would turn colors. One night she broke into a locel wine-maker&#39;s facility and stole a small barrel of wine and decanting equipment. Her parents quickly grew tired of this behavior and enrolled her in the local militia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Chloe&#39;s dichotomous attitude continued into her years of training with the militia. She enjoyed the challenge and growth but despised the regimen and boundaries. As a coping mechanism to bring more joy to her life, Chloe turned back to wine. She&#39;s been charged with dereliction of duty on numerous occasions. However, since her parents are high-ranking political advisors she has protection against any kind of discharge from her duties. Consequently, she floats through her duties during the day and returns to her passion for wine-making at night. She has a small tent outside of her family home within which she practices methods of decanting late into the twilight hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;}, &quot;uncategorized&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;wp:status&quot;=&gt;&quot;publish&quot;}, {&quot;ful-picture&quot;=&gt;1574}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords&quot;=&gt;[]}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms&quot;=&gt;[&quot;&quot;]}]}}</p>	</div> <!-- property line -->
