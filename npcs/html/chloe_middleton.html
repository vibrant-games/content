			<div class="property-line">Chloe is that &#39;bored-looking-guard&#39;. She will specifically make contact with adventurers who are passing through that look like they are willing and capable to stir the pot and cause a bit of &#39;no no&#39; amongst the population.</div><br />
		
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h3>Appearance</h3></div>
		<div class="property-line">	Rather plain jane appearance - couldn&#39;t be picked out of a crowd; Wearing the armor of the local militia acting as watchmen for the city/town; In off hours, Chloe wears bland dresses and tops but pays close attention to her hair and shoes as though compensating for her rather average appearance
		</div>
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h3>Expressions</h3></div>
		<div class="property-line">	 &quot;Can&#39;t make wine outta olives - some call me an olive, but I know I&#39;m a cherry!&quot;; &quot;Keeping the peace seems foolhardy when its the Kings and Queens that cause the conflicts in the first place&quot;; &quot;I say &#39;Stick it to em&#39;, gold-hungry scoundrels, they are&quot;;
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h3>Mannerisms</h3></div>
		<div class="property-line">	Timid at first glance but courageous in spirit, Chloe will often avoid engaging with others; Order/task oriented - goes from standing still to pointing and gesturing to the next task at hand; Most often found reading through her list of ingredients for her wines and her methods of making them; Sometimes throws a wrench in the gears of watchkeeping
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h3>Motivations</h3></div>
			<div class="property-line">Chloe wants to know as much as possible about fine wines and wine-making; more so than performing her duties for local magistrates. She also seeks to undermine law and order in the town or city where she serves.
</div>
		
		
			
			<div class="actions">
			<h3>Passions</h3></div>
		<div class="property-line">	Winemaking; Sommellier; undermining watchkeeping and the power of the masgistrates and royalty

		<h3>Background</h3></div>
		<span>	<p><p>Born and bred in the middle class market district of the city of Johseveille [Any major city], Chloe gained both a taste for and disdain for bourgeios comforts. Both of her parents were political advisors and urged Chloe into the same vocation but Chloe was rebellious in her youth, causing all kinds of trouble with local merchants and incoming adventurers. She was particularly notorious for getting so drunk on cherry or apple wine that her teeth would turn colors. One night she broke into a locel wine-maker's facility and stole a small barrel of wine and decanting equipment. Her parents quickly grew tired of this behavior and enrolled her in the local militia.</p><p>Needless to say, Chloe's dichotomous attitude continued into her years of training with the militia. She enjoyed the challenge and growth but despised the regimen and boundaries. As a coping mechanism to bring more joy to her life, Chloe turned back to wine. She's been charged with dereliction of duty on numerous occasions. However, since her parents are high-ranking political advisors she has protection against any kind of discharge from her duties. Consequently, she floats through her duties during the day and returns to her passion for wine-making at night. She has a small tent outside of her family home within which she practices methods of decanting late into the twilight hours.</p>
