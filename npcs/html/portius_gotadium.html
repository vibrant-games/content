      &lt;p&gt;For more info on the Doctor Class see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LkHeate-75getALqBBg&quot;&gt;GM Binder&#39;s Doctor Class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
|
&lt;p&gt;Life in the gnomish city of Aberash Caandu is always lively - filled with tinkerer products wobbling about and wondrous inventions that would amaze even the most experienced traveler. The gnomes of this city have always been accepting of all other races and inter-racial marriage and offspring are not uncommon. Portius is a product of this accepting community and raised in their meticulously productive and innovative cultural practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing from their youth that they were not only a mixed-race person but also gender fluid, Portius presents powerful qualities of both masculinity and femininity. With close-cut cropped hair and a muscular, broad build, they seem tomboyish. Yet their graceful hands and attention to details - in their work, appearance, and environment - reflect a feminine edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they matured, they took on the best of each race. They chose not to tinker, per se, at least not with &#39;inventions&#39; but instead with the biology of peoples. They took to the role of a doctor easily and quickly became the community&#39;s go-to for anything that would ail them. They also picked up on the talents of the local Dwarven community and learned the sophisticated methods of rectification - distilling and producing fine spirits. In addition, their skills with a sharp edge and attention to detail leant themselves well to barbering. Portius was and is seen as something of a pragmatic polymath. The wonderful outcome of the mixing of Gnomish and Dwarven genetics and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portius has since set out on their own to pursue a greater good among the regions. She has settled in the city of Tyrwind [any large city] where they have set up a sturdy shack on the outskirts of the market. Their small shop operates as an underclass clinic. Here she also distills and bottles fine spirits for sale to taverns, inns, and the public. She has a brand called, &quot;Moorehouse&#39;, made up of various rums and whiskeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portius has since joined the regional Doctors&#39; Guild, which has a small population of members. They have also been a founding member of the Rectifiers&#39; guild. Both to protect practitioners of little-known and rarely practiced professions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They seek to use their membership to these guilds to push them to dismantle - through strategically intellectual and political means - the mercantile churches. Because of these goals, she is currently a target of &lt;a href=&quot;https://getvibrantgames.com/npc2/morion-defaye/&quot;&gt;Morion DeFaye&lt;/a&gt; and his clergy. Although these mercantile abbots would never outright assassinate anyone, they keep close watch over her operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although very gender fluid in their performance of gender, Portius&#39; biological sex is female and her sexual preference oscillates frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
