The container has a seemingly endless source of whatever mundane object is selected, though it deteriorates from existence within a day of being removed from the container. When the command word is spoken and the container is opened, it reveals completely different contents. Stored in an extraplanar space, the container may store any amount that would make sense for the size of the container, and then by shutting the container, the bag will store the contents away until the command word is spoken again.&quot;]}, &quot;profile&quot;=&gt;{&quot;background-story&quot;=&gt;&quot;&lt;p&gt;The rise of empires has witnessed the mixing of races geographically and biologically. Hill Dwarves and Halflings have not only made peace but also engaged in mutually beneficial trade and craftsmanship. The villas of Jhandoo Marr - multiple settlements within the crags of the Eastern Fingers - are connected by various rope bridges and pulley trams. The populations of these villas combined the Halfling aptitude for creating fine clothes, textiles, and foods with Hill Dwarf expertise with gemology, metallurgy, and construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only has this alliance produced goods of wondrous value to the region but also unique individuals with a new mix of talents that the Realms have not yet seen. The mixing of minds had generated a large population of peoples with psionic abilities. Growing up in this culturally rich and diverse environment, Glem&#39;s psionics grew quickly, as did his recognition of the evolution of personal identity as an avenue for personal gain. He was able to see into peoples&#39; minds and personal identities and quickly gather the worth of identity to each individual, to each merchant, to the Bureau, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He thought to himself often, &lt;i&gt;if the Bureau of Population Control can mete out fees and fines for not having proper documents to prove who you are and what blood flows through your veins, then any of us can jump in on that process and, say, sift off a few coins here and there. With the proper expertise, of course.&lt;/i&gt; And it wasn&#39;t long before he sought training from the local guild of Identity Traders; a faction dedicated to undermining the controls imposed by the Bureau. It was here that he perfected his skills at forgery, made connections within the community, and grew his notoriety as the &#39;go-to&#39; for illegal documents required for trade, travel, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;}, &quot;uncategorized&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;wp:status&quot;=&gt;&quot;publish&quot;}, {&quot;subclass&quot;=&gt;&quot;Soulknife&quot;}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords&quot;=&gt;[]}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms&quot;=&gt;[&quot;&quot;]}]}}</p>	</div> <!-- property line -->
