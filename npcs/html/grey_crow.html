									<p2>As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can&#39;t duplicate the appearance of a creature you&#39;ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren&#39;t changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</p2><br>

									<p2>You can see and speak with spirits. You can see up to 60 ft into the Ethereal Plane while in the Material Plane, and vice versa. You can also gain some benefits after communing with nature for 1 minute. When you forage alone, you find twice as much as you normally would. You can move stealthily at a normal pace. You are aware of recent events in the region, like storms, landslides, etc.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Spiritual Animal</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can cast the &quot;Find Familiar&quot; spell as a ritual. Your familiar is always an undead. Your familiar is a spirit, which means it can see 60 ft into the Ethereal Plane while in the Material Plane and vice versa, it can pass through other creatures and objects (it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn on an occupied space), it doesn&#39;t have a walking speed, instead, it has a flight speed of 40ft and it can hover (familiars that already have flight speeds keep their value, but lose their walking speed like the others) and it can become invisible with an action.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Spiritual Possession</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use your action to enter a trance and allow a beastly spirit to possess your body, giving you the abilities of the spirit. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. (Optional Rule - the Shaman must have collected the spirit of the animal you wish to channel. to collect you must be aware of the spirit of a creature that meets the requirements and succeed on an animal handling check. When using this rule some monstrosities such as winter wolf may be allowed). Your shaman level determines the spirit that can possess you. You can be possessed by the spirit of a beast with a CR of no more than half your shaman level (rounded down). When you channel you do not gain lair actions or legendary resistances. You can maintain the possession by a number of hours equal to half your shaman level (rounded down). You then end the possession unless you expend another use of this feature.. You can also end the possession with a bonus action in your turn. You automatically end the possession if you fall to 0 hit points, or die. While you are possessed, the following rules apply</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>1. Some of your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast whose spirit is possessing you. Those being, its Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores, its attacks, its senses and any other personal features. You don&#39;t gain its hit points, AC, or any special types of movement (like flight). Changes in Dex or Con do not effect your AC or HP and only apply for the sake of checks, saves, and attacks.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>2. When you use your action to make an attack from your possessing spirit it appears as a spectral apparition of the attack, and while you deal the damage type and dice of the attack, you still use your weapon on the attack, so, if you use a ranged weapon, like a bow, you can still make any attack from your spirit, like a bite attack. Also, any extra damage, or bonus to attack rolls you gain from magical weapons still affect your spirit attacks.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>3. Your spirit&#39;s senses overlap yours, so you lose any senses you possess that your spirit doesn&#39;t posses with exception to your ethereal sight.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>4. At level 7 your spirit&#39;s attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity against nonmagical damage and attacks. When you reach 11th level, you gain temporary hit points equal to your shaman level when you become possessed. These hit points last until the end of the possession.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Shamanistic Ascension</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You choose a Shamanistic Ascension that show how to you use your connection with the spirits; Totem of Elements and Totem of Spirits. You gain additional features from your shamanistic ascension at levels 6, 10, and 14.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Totem of Spirits</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you choose the shamanistic ascension of the Totem of Spirits, you wish to deepen your connection to the spirits around you, surround yourself in their presence, and count on them to help you.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Mortuary Totem - At 3rd Level, you have a totem that serves as a mortuary tablet, where your spirits can reside. You can use your Spirit Possession with a bonus action, rather than your action. Also, once per long rest you can swap your current spirit and be possessed by a different one. This change doesn&#39;t affect the duration of the possession (so, if there were only 3 minutes left, your new spirit stays in you for only 3 minutes). A sudden change like that is vary taxing, you gain 1 level of exhaustion after your possession ends if you used this feature during it.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Spiritual Medium - At 6th level you have learned a way to strengthen your bond with your spirits. If you have a medium that connects a spirit to its original existence (like bear claws for a bear spirit), you can use it to draw out more power from it. You spirit gains a more physical form, the aura around you becoming denser. Your spirit&#39;s attacks damage type becomes force damage. And you can spend spell slots to increase this damage. You gain 1 more dice of damage per level of spell slot used this way (black bear&#39;s bite with a 4th level spell slot would deal 5d6 force damage, instead of the normal 1d6). This increase in damage lasts until the end of your current turn.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Spirit Senses - At level 10 you are able to detect the presence of spirits even at great distances. As an action you allow your connection to the ethereal plane guide your senses to these creatures. For 10 minutes you know the location of any creature of the undead type within 100 ft of you. With another action you can increase your focus and learn 2 things</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>The exact number of creatures you&#39;re sensing.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You gain a glimpse of their power. The DM gives tells you if the creature is - weak (CR 0 to 1), average (CR 2 to 4), strong (CR 5 to 9), powerful (CR 10 to 15), fearsome (CR 15 to 20), terrifying (CR 21 to 26), monstrous (CR 27 to 30).</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use this feature once per short or long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Spiritual Armor - Starting at level 14 you are able to create a special totem, that is able to condense your possessing spirit into a much denser aura. With a bonus action you activate this form that lasts for 1 minute. While in this form you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your shaman level times your Wisdom modifier, to a maximum of 5 (if your modifier is higher than 5, treat it as a 5 when calculating these hit points).</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>This feature can be used once. To use it again you must finish a long rest.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Bridge Between Worlds</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can, once every long rest, with your strong spiritual power, create a number of totems equal to your wisdom Modifier + 2. These totems can be used by your allies, connecting them with the Ethereal Plane, allowing them to see what you see. The totems can be activated with a bonus action. For 1 hour your allies, who activated their totems, can see into the ethereal plane just like you.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Vengeful Spirits</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Then targeting a creature with a spell that forces them to make a Wisdom saving throw you can choose to loose angry spirits along with the spell. Once per short rest, you can use this feature to make the target make their initial Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed saving throw the spirits torment the target&#39;s mind, causing the spell to deal double damage, or last twice as long, your choice if the spell has a duration and causes damage. On a success, nothing happens.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Grand Shaman</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use your Spirit Possession an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your shaman spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.</p2><br>

							<p><b><h4></h4></b></p><p> </p>
									
									
									
										
							<p1><b>Silver Dagger</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>This silver dagger is of the same familty as the Githyanki&#39;s sacred weapons, and are capable of cutting the cord that tethers a creature to their astral body. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you attack a creature&#39;s astral body (that is, the creature is under the effect of the astral projection spell or similar magic) and the attack was a critical hit, you sever that creature&#39;s astral cord.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Twin Snake Belt</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While wearing this belt it gives an extra +2 bonus to his AC. The belt can be grasped by the wearer and tossed to the ground (treating the wearer as proficient) with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon impact, the belt becomes two small vipers. If either of the snakes are killed or leave 100 feet from the wearer, they return to belt form upon the wearer instantly. Slain snakes cannot be re-summoned for 24 hours. They can be recalled as a standard action but otherwise may be summoned at will. Poison taken from or injuring a creature vanishes if the inflicting snake returns to belt form (but otherwise not any damage the poison may have already caused).</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Cloak of Displacement</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While you wear this cloak, it projects an Illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual Location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on Attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are Incapacitated, Restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Rod of Absorption</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell&#39;s effect is canceled, and the spell&#39;s energy, not the spell itself is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can&#39;t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can&#39;t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Ring of Evasion</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>This ring has 3 Charges, and it regains 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your Reaction to expend 1 of its Charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Ring of Mind Shielding</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other Creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your Alignment, or know your Creature Type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use an action to cause the ring to become Invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for The Afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can&#39;t prevent this Telepathic Communication.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Staff of the Woodlands</b></p1><br>

									<p2>The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff&#39;s charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Animal Friendship (1 charge)</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Awaken (5 charges)</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Barkskin (2 charges)</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Locate Animals or Plants (2 charges)</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Speak with Animals (1 charge)</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Speak with Plants (3 charges)</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Wall of Thorns (6 charges).</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can also use an action to cast the pass without trace spell from the staff without using any charges</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>Tree Form - You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Bag of Holding</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its Contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p2><br>

									Grey Crow was once the shaman of her primitive tribe. During one of her journey's into the astral plane to speak with the spirits, she was touched by the Forbidden Gods. Their touch corrupted her spirit and her mind, 
leaving her their emmisary, walking the earth and sewing chaos in her wake. She returned to her body a corrupted being, and immediately proceeded to slaughter her tribe. Since then, she has walked the earth, doing the
bidding of her masters, preparing the world for their return. Somewhere along the line, she came into posession of a silver dagger forged by the Githyanki and capale of severing astral cords.

									Grey Crow is an exceedingly cunning liar and trickster. She is completely mad and derranged, but hides it well when it suits her needs. Her favorite game is to approach strangers out of the night, joining their campfire
as an elderly traveller on her own seeking shelter and companionship. She will then turn their secrets against them and use them to steer adventureres from their path. She likes to play tricks and jokes that cause as much 
choas as possible and uses her shapeshifting abilities to cause as much confusion and mistrust as possible with parties. She will rarely venture into large towns or cities, prefering to stick to the wilds. One of her
favorite tricks is convincing adventureres to travel with her to the Astral Plane with her, then using her silver dagger to sever their astral cord, leaving her victims dead and unrevivable.
