      &lt;p&gt;The Halflings of Yeilumph [Any Small Halfling Town] are known for their high quality of life and especially their indulgences. This community loves to develop the finest of all things pleasurable, from candies to sexual events, from the most exotic crossbred fruit to the jams made from those fruit to use as fillings in a wondrous danish. The population of Yeilumph hold the belief that these indulgences are the answer to life&#39;s troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Cruda. A young halfing woman who loved a good slice of Sylvan Nut Bread with Apple butter for breakfast every morning, followed by a tart Flumberry Danish and a good swig of Pine Brew Cider to wash it all down. Her love for pastries and breads meant that she spent most of her time at the local bakery interacting with the baker and all of her staff. Slowly but surely, Gruda learned the trade. Along the way she also uncovered new methods of growing grains to produce different colors and textures. The innovation was so spectacular for the shop and the trade in general that the people nicknamed her, &quot;Wheatsheaf&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gruda longed to spread the joy of baked goods to the rest of the realm. She took the coin she earned for her innovation and purchased a small home in the nearby city of PinionMast [Any major trade City]. She gleefully carted her supplies and goods to the markets of PinionMast. Upon arriving in town to offer her fine baked goods it seemed there was little to no competition. Gruda had a corner on the tastiest baked goods around. She longs to open her very own shop one day.&lt;/p&gt;
