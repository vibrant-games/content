This allows you to identify magic tattoos with a successful check as well as understand basic warnings and information communicated through markings&quot;, &quot;Lasting Inspiration&quot;=&gt;&quot;you can imbue your Bardic Inspiration into a tattoo. When you are tattooing someone, you may expend all remaining uses of your Bardic Inspiration to imbue one Bardic Inspiration die into the tattoo. The tattoo receives your current Bardic Inspiration die and does not increase when you increase in level. Once the tattoo is complete, the bearer may use a bonus action to activate the tattoo, adding your Bardic Inspiration die to their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once the recipient has used the tattoo in this fashion, it cannot be used again until they complete a long rest. You may add Lasting Inspiration to any tattoo you craft, be it magical or not. Adding Lasting Inspiration to a magical tattoo does not impact or impede its other effects in any way. Once your Bardic Inspiration die has increased, you may spend one hour performing a touch up on a tattoo you have previously invested with Lasting Inspiration. At the end of the hour, you expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration. Once this is complete, the Lasting Inspiration die increases to your current Bardic Inspiration die. You cannot perform touch ups in this way on another artist’s tattoos. In addition, you are now considered to have achieved the necessary tattoo artist notoriety required to study under an established tattoo adept, even if you have never maintained a shop&quot;}]}<br>

When you are tattooing someone, you may expend all remaining uses of your Bardic Inspiration to imbue one Bardic Inspiration die into the tattoo.

Once the tattoo is complete, the bearer may use a bonus action to activate the tattoo, adding your Bardic Inspiration die to their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once the recipient has used the tattoo in this fashion, it cannot be used again until they complete a long rest. You may add Lasting Inspiration to any tattoo you craft, be it magical or not. Adding Lasting Inspiration to a magical tattoo does not impact or impede its other effects in any way. Once your Bardic Inspiration die has increased, you may spend one hour performing a touch up on a tattoo you have previously invested with Lasting Inspiration. At the end of the hour, you expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration. Once this is complete, the Lasting Inspiration die increases to your current Bardic Inspiration die. You cannot perform touch ups in this way on another artist’s tattoos. In addition, you are now considered to have achieved the necessary tattoo artist notoriety required to study under an established tattoo adept, even if you have never maintained a shop&quot;}]}<br>

									Kraven is not infected. He is what one would call a 'true' weretiger born of the breed in the jungles of Khuile [Any isolated vilage of Weretigers]. Set upon a collection of river mouths draining into the sea, he and his
brood were also skilled sea-men. His clan claim to be descendents of the original weretigers and remain staunchly noble in their dealings with others with the hopes of changing public opinion towards lycanthropes.
Kraven set forth on such an information campaign but was met with rebukes and violence. His lycanthropic form was incredibly dangerous in defence of many violent altercations, many of which unfortunately resulted in
murders. Kraven thus turned his hand to what was in his heart: sailing, artwork, shadows, magic, mystery, and music. Combining these passions, Kraven is one of the first and only tattoo artists in the region who can
offer magic tattoos - at a costly price.
