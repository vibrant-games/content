Instead they are most drawn to whatever individual inspires invention!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaz cultivated his capacity for invention and steam technology and his gadgets gained popularity among the sailors and merchants of Barrelheist. Always chipper and looking for the good in things, Kaz successfully disguises a certain disdain for wealthy people that he acquired living much like an urchin in a shanty town frequented by the noble and affluent.
