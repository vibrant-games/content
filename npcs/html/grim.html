        Story
      </a>
    </div>

    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Grim was born to cabbage farmers in the halfling outfront, in a community of free spirits where parentage was never quite traceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised by the whole village, her education was unfocused. She never learned the meticulously careful hoeing techniques to keep cabbage lands shoot- and weed-free; she invariably lost interest in digging irrigation channels before they were finished; and her patience for leading ox-dragons over the fields while feeding them grains and chili peppers, to fertilize the crops, was low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grim instead found her calling in the social gatherings of the village, and learned the fundamentals of music on lute and banjo from an elder, who died abruptly one winter in an horrific hydrogen sulfide explosion caused by overcooked cabbage leaves.  Grim&#39;s rudimentary stringed instrument skills, and her saccharine voice, soon earned her a following, both at home and, as travelers passed through town, in neighboring villages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her popularity grew, Grim added performance art to her shows, and began collaborating with other musicians, especially young female halflings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her relationship with One Skul began during a tour of the fire elf tribes of [desert], during which she also discovered hallucinogens and astral projection.  It is unclear whether One Skul himself lived with the fire elf tribes, or whether he arrived on his Ansible of Motion, or through an astral portal opened by Grim, largely because he has circulated all three rumors, and probably can&#39;t remember or distinguish reality from narrative any more in any case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grim alternates between performing locally in her current home town for months at a time, and touring the countryside for a few months, avoiding any town where Pyppo is performing along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grim is readily offended by people -- especially men -- giving her advice about her music or about the bardic industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tales of adventure or of fantasy and wonder will knock Grim out of her catatonic brassica highs.  She enjoys a good adventure story, and her spontaneous, improvisational instinct will send her along on an adventure, too, if the opportunity presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
