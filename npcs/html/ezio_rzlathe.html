His family chose this because they witnessed the fascist matriarchical hierarchy of Lollth [Or similar Evil Drow God]. Alongside this, the tribe heard rumors and saw evidence that the Great Old Ones were on the rise to reclaim their positions of power over the material and astral planes. The great Jackal Irrt, the Lord of Hunger, Thirst, Famine, and Drought, and Moander, the Lord of Growth and Decay [Two Forgotten Gods] are separately surging forward into the hearts and minds of those in the underdark and those few clans who wander the middle-ground between the upperworld and the Underdark. Disaffected with fascist rulers, Ezio&#39;s tribe rejected and became fervent enemies of the ruling pantheons of the Underdark. Learning of the power and promise of the Forgotten Gods, Ezio&#39;s clan began offering faith and tithings to Ommen-Hurr [A different Forgotten God], the goddess of Shadow and Time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their growing size and relative power, other apostatic clans who followed other Old Gods became violent towards Ezio&#39;s tribe. One fateful night, the followers of Irrt summoned aspects of the deity to the material realm to strike. Massive jackals with gnashing teeth and almost rotted skin hanging loosely from their frames were unleashed on Ezio&#39;s village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demon hounds descended on the Underground city of Daur’zzwth (Dar-zooth) [or any Drow or Underdark village] that Ezio and his people called home. One of these great demon hounds sought out Ezio’s father and uncle especially, invaded their home, and assaulted the family. Ezio’s father, Ziirr’kho (Zee-rick-oh) and uncle Ras’klnn (Raz-kill- non) bravely fought the beast, bringing it near death, yet both Drow heroes were left close to death themselves. A young Ezio, terrified and protecting the youth in the basement of the home, silently dashed out of the cellar trap-door to grasp his father’s powerful shortsword. The demon hound circled, smelling victory, and, due to injury and pride, did not sense Ezio lurking in the shadows around the outside of the room. Drooling and snapping its jaws in naïve glee, the beast slowly approached the two men. Ezio leapt from the shadows and sunk the blade deep into the beasts eye, killing it. He’s since been a family hero. The tribe has taken it upon themselves to train him as an Assassin and Diplomat and send him forth into the Upperworld to cause chaos and make way for their rise to power.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;}, &quot;uncategorized&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;wp:status&quot;=&gt;&quot;publish&quot;}, {&quot;ful-picture&quot;=&gt;1192}, {&quot;token-picture&quot;=&gt;1193}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords&quot;=&gt;[]}, {&quot;_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms&quot;=&gt;[&quot;&quot;]}]}}</p>	</div> <!-- property line -->
