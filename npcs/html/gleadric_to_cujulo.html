    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Gleadric was raised in a Firbolg stronghold in the remote forests of Yyl on the outskirts of known civilization. The pivoting day in his youth, when his shamanic calling took control of his dreams and appended them to his woken life, was nearly crippling at first; changing him from the day-to-day gentle tenderer to flora into a seemingly secretive tanner and collector of furs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve changed.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; One of his closest friends imparted, &lt;i&gt;&quot;but...change is life.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; He patted Gleandric on the back while Cujuloa continued stripping a large Bison of it&#39;s hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gleadric became two spirits inhabiting one physical body. Cujuloa was largely in charge of his daily productive activities - invoking dreams in his waking life and providing soft, warm dreams to his peoples - while Gleadric remained in control of his interactions with his community. However, Cujuloa demanded that they take their firm beliefs in equality and profound spirituality to the civilized communities and that they find new means and ways to bring peoples back to the basic love of for flora and fauna. They believe that by building room in the market for impressive hide and fur trade - a return to more primitive and anarchic ways - while impressing the importance of adhering to dreams over the purported reality of the waking world; that this will bring peoples back to their essential being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goals, along with their split psyche, make social appearances, well, a challenge in situations relying on a finely detailed social contract. They come across to most as wild or &#39;crazy&#39;, but upon closer inspection and interactions, their distilled spirituality leaves a mark of genuine good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on which spirit is taking charge, they refer to themselves in 3rd person - either Gleadric or Cujuloa.
