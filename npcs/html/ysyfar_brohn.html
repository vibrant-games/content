    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;A war erupted in the recent past in the Fhinnenqaal Range [expansive mountain range] between Mountain Dwarves and Drow battling for control over the myriad passages and veins of ore contained in the region. This war disturbed more than the populations of Mountain Dwarves and Drow. Ongoing skirmishes spilled over into Tiefling villages nestled within the cave entrances to the Fhinnengal Range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither population were aware that these Tieflings praised Kenaan [or another Tiefling God of Destruction], whose nihilistic followers only became more fervent in their belief that the destruction of the Realm is the only cure for the madness infecting the other races and peoples.Ysyfar was born and raised in this culture and inculcated with their deep religious beliefs and rituals that centered on eradicating not just the peoples of the realm, but the realm itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gained popularity among his people for his religious services that provided vicious and scathing diatribes condemning the other races. As the war spilled over into surrounding villages, Ysyfar proudly organized forces to defend his people. This religious paramilitary group gradually grew into an offensive force and Ysyfar was granted leadership as Martial of Kenaan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an entourage of soldiers of his order, this devoutly faithful warrior travels the region visiting temples of various deities to evaluate their role in the wars that characterize the races. He is very calculated in these &#39;visits&#39;, aware that he and his Order, while not well known, are not accepted nor desired among the other communities of the region. Often found in deep prayer at the entrance to a temple or to a statuette of a deity acceptable to Kenaan, Ysyfar will rarely compromise his maleficent pilgrimage and instead do everything possible to keep himself and his entourage appearing as peaceful pilgrims from a respectable Order.&lt;/p&gt;
