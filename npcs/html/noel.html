			<h4>Special Abilities</h4>
			<p>There are some downsides to having amnesia. When Noel finds out about their past, if events go against their current alignment, Noel would make a wisdom saving throw (DC 10). If they fail, they take 1d4 physic damage and that damage is removed from their max HP.

Noel starts as a Ranger. When the DM reveals more information about Noel&#39;s past through the story, Noel is able to reflect those changes on their character sheet: Meaning that if in Noel&#39;s past, the DM reveals they were a thief, Noel could obtain proficiency in thief&#39;s tools, or even multiclass as a rogue. This special ability can happen at anytime and is not related to experience, but is up to the DM.

<h3>Background</h3>
		<span>	<p>Noel was not always a warforged. They remember the grass upon their feet and the taste of mead, but nothing else, not even their name. The name Noel comes from an old manufacturing plate located on the body they woke up in: Number 31 (No.31). The body was long ago discarded. Noel awoke in a mass grave of warforged with only a name in their head. The are not sure if the name is theirs or if it is someone they once knew. They have been searching for answers to no prevail. They have been kicked out of towns and shunned from inns for the way they look. They have only ever found sanctuary in temples and alone in the woods.  They have resorted to requesting local clerics to ask around about the faceless name for any answers.

The true backstory of this character is up to the DM. Is this character somehow connected to your party or the BBEG? 
|
were they in a romantic partnership with a necromancer or Lich and when they died, their partner did everything they could to bring them back? 
Were they a warlock that made a deal with their patron? After they died did the patron put their soul into a machine for them to continue to serve? Are those memories actually their own, or are they being manipulated? 
|
There are so many possibilities, that I wouldn't feel right cementing only one background for this character. Adjust as needed for your own campaign.
