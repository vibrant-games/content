									<p2>At 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with your power, creating a permanent magical item that replaces a lost limb—a hand, arm, foot, leg, or similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. The wearer can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against the wearer’s will. It detaches if the wearer dies.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Battlefist</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 3rd level you replace one of your arms with a battlefist, a magical prosthetic you created. Your battlefist is a simple melee weapon, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. While your battlefist is a magical weapon, it can be infused as if it were a nonmagical weapon. When you attack with your battlefist, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the attack roll. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength or Intelligence modifier. At 9th level, the damage dealt by your battlefist increases to 2d10 + your Strength or Intelligence modifier. Additionally, you can choose one of the following weapon properties to add to your battlefist - finesse, thrown (range 20/60), or reach. When you finish a long rest, you can replace this property with a different weapon property from the list.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Extra Attack</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Improved Battlefist</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>At 9th level, you have modified your battlefist in both mundane and magical ways. It gains the following benefits When you infuse your battlefist, you can apply two infusions to it at a time. If both infusions grant bonuses to your attack rolls or armor class, you gain only the greater bonus. Your battlefist is also a shield, increasing your armor class by 2. You can wield it as a weapon even if you are using it as a shield. You can infuse it as if it were both a simple melee weapon and a shield. The maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 1, but the extra infusion must be applied to your battlefist.</p2><br>

									Thadeus Periwinkle came by his biological research in the most unfortunate fashion. Growing up as a monster hunter and tracker, his party were tracking a den of Trolls that had been terrorizing local villages. 
The party was taken by surprise and Thadeus was the only survivor. When he was found by travellers, he had lost his left arm and left leg and a good sized chunk of the flesh from his chest. He was healed and 
revived but what was gone was gone. In his search to rebuild his body, he stumbled across the lore of artifice and began to study its skills and processes. After learning some of the secrets, he began to rebuild 
his broken body from steel and magic. He has given himself a mechanical arm, leg and armored the missing parts of his chest. Because of his skill in developing mechanized prostectics and his studies into biology, 
Thadeus was recruited into the Collegium by Oswald Vardklemp where he has continued develop his research

									Thadeus Periwinkle is a tall and thin Half-Elf. He has short, blonde hair and pointed ears and scars on his face. He almost always wears a long trenchcoat or lab coat to cover the mechanized components of his body. 
Considereing his trauma and the fact that he is almost constantly in pain, he is generally pleasant and personable. He has long ago accepted that he's never getting his body back, but has been methodical and devoted 
in continuing to upgrade his prostectics. His devotion to his work and knowledge of upgrading humanoid forms has led him to work closely and become fast friends with Ulther Hapwath as they pursue their goals together.
