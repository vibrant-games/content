    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;A young Dwarven boy grew up in the mining village of Duncarve. Raised in a family of &#39;second-handers&#39; - bandsmen and drags-men who would load and operate the mining carts - he was subjected to a mundane life of daily servitude. Load the cart. Steer the cart. Unload the cart. It was exhausting. He grew especially tired of watching the purveyors of the mine increase the quality of their lifestyle and of the increased riches of the merchants and oresmen who would deal in the precious materials Claideighm would cart around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bah!&lt;/i&gt; He thought to himself. &lt;i&gt;This is no way to live. A slave to the gold and servile to those who deal in it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hypermasculine environment of the mines and mercantile trading classes that frequented his family shop crept under his skin. Under his skin. That&#39;s a place he would rarely visit. When he did, he knew he was out of place. And not just because of his distaste for servitude. No. It was his distaste for himself. This was not who he was really meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claideighm decided to run away at an early age before he was further inculcated into the unescapable lifestyle and traditions of his village. He followed a merchant caravan to a nearby city and was suddenly exposed to sights and sounds, flavors and scents, skin tones and textures, that he&#39;d never seen before. His psyche was on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short period of time in the city Claideighm created a new narrative for himself. One that fit. He recognized that his natural figure was more attractive to the males of the races. He realized that sex and his hunger for it was a commodity under his control rather than under the control of some mercantile class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He redeemed his soul the moment he found and purchased his first runed pants and placed his slender frame in a the shadows of the streets for passing merchants to admire. His increasing androgyny worked in his favor. They exploited them for their money at every turn and began to identify themself as neither man nor woman.They are now well-known as one of the most charming &#39;courtesans&#39; in the major cities of the region.&lt;/p&gt;
