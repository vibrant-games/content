    <div class="background-story">
      Steve grew up working the streets, fighting and stealing to survive. He&#39;s an accomplished pickpocket and in his youth had a reputation as a break-in specialist. He&#39;s an angry cold-blooded fellow who has no qualms about stabbing first and asking questions later. As he aged, he became less adept at execution and worked more on the planning side of robberies. One time his greed got the better of him and he betrayed his allies on a job. As punishment, the Thieve&#39;s Guild took his eye, stripped him of his responsibilities for planning jobs and stuck him behind the bar at the tavern that hides their secret hall. He&#39;s basically a glorified doorman for the guild and he resents every second of it. He does however, have a permanent reminder to not betray the guild again. He&#39;s mean and doesn&#39;t care for serving customers at all, he gets paid whether anyone is drinking or not. He keeps a hand crossbow behind the bar and a dagger on his belt in case any trouble makes it past the security outside the door
