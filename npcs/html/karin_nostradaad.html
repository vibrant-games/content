    <div class="background-story">
      Karin is a lieutenant in the Bakerfield Family thieves guild. He is responsible for the neighbourhoods on the north, central part of the city and he gleefully squeezes every last copper piece out of the people that live there.
|
He is not the smartest of Varun&#39;s Lieutenants, but he is the most sadistic. Causing pain and suffering is not merely a means to an end with Karin, it is a source of pleasure. Missing a protection payment will have merchants on the wrong end of a savage beating at the hands of this smiling giant.
|
Karin grew up in a modest middle class family until they were murdered in cold blood when he was 10 years old. His mother was an only child and her parents died when Karin was still very young. His father was estranged from his family and refused to take Karin in. He found himself living on the streets begging for food until a Bakerfield family crew took him on as a petty thief.
|
As he grew up, his muscles grew out. As did his temper and his taste for blood and tears.
|
Aside from running his district, when Varun Bakerfield needs someone to deliver a particularly brutal beating or physical intimidation, Karin is likely to get the call.
