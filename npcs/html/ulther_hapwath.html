							<p><b><h4></h4></b></p><p> </p>
									
									
									
										
							<p1><b>Transmutation Savant</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>The gold and time you must spend to copy a Transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Minor Alchemy</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>When you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Transmuters Stone</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter&#39;s stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature&#39;s possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options; Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered Proficiency in Constitution saving throws Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit) Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter&#39;s stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Shapechanger</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You add the Polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast Polymorph in this way, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot</p2><br>
							        
											
										
							<p1><b>Master Transmuter</b></p1><br>
											
									
							        
											
										
							
											
									<p2>You can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter&#39;s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter&#39;s stone is destroyed and can&#39;t be remade until you finish a long rest. Major Transformation - You can transmute one nonmagical object – no larger than a 5-foot cube – into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it. Panacea - You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter&#39;s stone. The creature also regains all its hit points. Restore Life - You cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter&#39;s stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook. Restore Youth - You touch the transmuter&#39;s stone to a willing creature, and that creature&#39;s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn&#39;t extend the creature&#39;s lifespan.</p2><br>

									Ulther Hapwath was originally a human but has spent most of their adult life experimaneting on and augmenting his own body in search of some distorted view of human perfection. A skilled spell slinger and hunter, 
they hunt and capture many specimens of various creatures to study and experiment on. They are a brilliant biologist with an exceptional knowledge of many different creatures anatomy and the steady hands of a 
surgeon. Recruited by Gerhardt Klippstein to join the Collegium for their vast biological knowledge, their employers are slightly less than keen on the reckless abandon with which they are willing to experiment 
on themselves. Since they joined the Collegium, they have been contacted by a mysterious benefactor from beyond the veil. Ulther has no idea who this benefactor is, but they have been helping to guild their 
self-evolution and in the creation of a substance called Cytoplast, a sort of ooze that helps with the bonding of upgrades and grants temporary healing when applied to a living creature.  Ulther's benefactor is 
in fact, the disembodied spirit Momir Vig, disgraced and deceased former Guildmaster of the Simic Combine on the Plane of Ravnica. Somehow Momir has crossed into this world and is slowly using Ulther to create 
Cytoplast and use it to build him a new body.

									Ulther Hapwath is tall and muscular and severe-looking with pale blue skin and long. hip length, silver/white hair. They wears dark glasses as their replaced eyes are somewhat sensative to bright lights, and a 
long, black leather trenchcoat that cover most of their bodily features. On closer inspection, its clear that Ulther has made significant modification to their body. Barbed skin on their hands and feet like a 
spider for climbing, the wings of a manta for gliding, sections of crab-like shell armoring portions of their body and a segmented scorpions tail with stinger are all faintly noticeable if someone spends enough 
time looking at them, although they are often using some kind of glamour (disguise self, polymorph, etc.) when in public so as not to stand out as much. Ulther is fanatical about his work and about chasing his 
personal concept of bodily perfection and finds it hard to comprehend why everyone isn't seeking to augment thier bodies. They are reckless and never think twice about experimenting on themselves and have little 
regard for the wellbeing of the other creatures that they experiment on. Thanks to the influence of their secret benefactor, they have gradually started to explore the commonly unknown arcane study of biomancy. 
While mostly keeping this information to themselves, they have shared some of their studies with their close friend and fellow body-modifying scientist and Collegium member Thadeus Periwinkle.
