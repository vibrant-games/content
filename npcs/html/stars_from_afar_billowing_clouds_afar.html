    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Although still highly spiritual and loyal to his tribe at his core, Afar&#39;s time with the tinkering Hill Gnomes of Riddiruck Falls changed him. Always a bright Tabaxi, he was never given the chance to realize his true calling until introduced to tinkering. When his nomadic tribe came upon the village and befriended the genius gnomes, it wasn&#39;t long before AFar bid farewell to his tribe in favor of studying the arts of technology and artifice. He stayed in the village late into his life and was a collaborator on many of their greatest cityscape inventions. As old age set in, so did senility of sorts. Although still highly skilled and able to apply himself to his processes of invention, he has become a sort of wandering Don Quixote figure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inventor cat-man with scruffy beard, pronounced tabard, bronze morion, and iron mastiff, is looking to bring light to the lives of others through his wild inventions. With his natural charm accented by his &#39;lost kitty&#39; Quixotic creativity, he has established himself as a local merchant who incomprehensibly wheels and deals in his inventions and other remarkable goods. He is always rummaging through the city garbage and will never turn down purchasing &#39;trade-in&#39; oddities and &#39;another man&#39;s garbage&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
