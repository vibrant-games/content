      <td> The Drow are a largely rejected race in the Realms. Numeorus tribes have departed from traditional ways in hopes of achieving peace for themselves and between themselves and the denizens of the Upper World. The clans 
of Dire Dawa [Any Underdark Village] of North Woreda [Any Underdark Region] seek such noble ends. A self-appointed council of diplomats in this village have made it their goal to spread the word that the people of the 
Underdark are best set to survive and flourish with the cooperation of the other races of the Realms. Since most magic is under strict control within most of the Underdark and thus messages and missives are 
difficult to convey, the peoples of Dire Dawa needed to rely on actual footwork to pass messages between and across the peoples of the Underdark who sought to escape the control of the few dark deities who had gained 
the majority of control in the regions. They relied on &#39;runners&#39; to bring messages back and forth. Abrinet was chosen as one of the few to play this revered position. Although not the fittest or most able, it was 
her commitment to absolving the Underdark of its ills that convinced her town council to appoint her as a &#39;runner&#39;. She has yet to let them down, except for her more than occasional travels to the Upperworld.

      <td> After years in the city of Hula-krah [Any sky city in the Plane of Air] as a Peacekeeper and high-ranking military official, overlooking the material planes in all their woes, Aeureek decided it was the duty of her 
people to bring justice to the ground. She conferred with officals and family about her decision and they were all in agreeance; it was time for the people of the sky to bring the freedom of true justice to the greedy 
land-dwellers. Aeureek and numerous other worthy and authorized members of the community were sent on their way to aid the ground-dwellers. Aeureek settled into the crime-ridden town of Helmsloft [Any major city that 
could suffer from heavy crime] and confidently approached the town&#39;s magistrates. She provided a convincing speech as to how the city required changes to their policing and corrections training and the corresponding 
structures. With her regal appearance and voice supporting a well-thought out and honest speech, which included numerous accurate observations Aeureek had gathered from his observations in the clouds, the magistrates 
were convinced to make such changes. Aeureek was offered a position among the magistrates but firmly declined, asserting that her abilities would best suit a position among the officers and within the confines of the 
slums and markets. Since then, Aeureek has been a well-respected and often feared officer and an advisor to the magistrates.

      <td> Aeureek&#39;s bird-like features are akin to that of a falcon with featehrs of whites, browns and greys; She has died various feathers bright reds and purples. She maintains exceptional posture at all times and is always 
dressed in formal white magistrate&#39;s gowns. She is all business in her role as an advisor to surface-dwelling magistrates, but is also exceptionally vain and constantly fusses over her appearance.

direction. The two elves remark to each other about the rarity they see nailing shingles to the roof of the new tavern. A half-orc? A feral dwarf? They cannot be certain. His muscular body and scars tell a story 
of a man who is not civilized, per se. A man who would unleash rage upon them. The elves depart. The progeny of a Dwarven slave woman who answered to Orcish slavers in a barbaric tribe, Albrecht had no true connection 
to family, as one might know it, except to hate others and unleash rage upon those who challenge him. Tired of the poor and sloppy indulgences of his tribe, Albrecht sought greater wealth and power. He followed a 
trading caravan he saw passing in the distance of the plains, offering to help them with any repairs or services they might need. He continued on with this &#39;hired-hand&#39; type business upon arriving in the town of 
Meership Downs, a small sailing port and bustling sea-side community. Here he grew his talents, but also his hatred for other races as the village was frequented by many types of people carousing, drinking, fighting, 
and all-around ne&#39;er-do-wells. Now, Albrecht focuses on having his &#39;stamp&#39; on as many buildings, ships, wagons, and so forth, as he possibly can. He puts his anger and hatred into his work knowing that unleashing his 
rage would not only be dangerous for others, but most certainly for himself.
 </td>
      <td> Albrecht is not a very nice man. Most people he meets find him racist, abrasive, short and angry. Despite his less than personable disposition, it&#39;s difficult for anyone to complain about the quality of his work. He is an 
exceptionally talented tradesman and runs a tight ship on his job sites. He has worked hard over the years to build his reputation and even harder to curve his temper. He&#39;s been known to charge a little too much for his work
and no compunction about overcharging and ripping off naive clients, and will argue tooth and nail over his prices. </td>

them to travel and be constantly on the move. They also regularly change ships and crews as often as possible to prevent people from learning the truth about what they are. They will usually serve as both a lookout and 
entertainment on the ships, they will also occasionally function as a companion for the ships captain if the mood takes them. If they need to, they can transform and escape from a situation underwater. They&#39;re main goal

      <td> Many years ago, after the murder of her wealthy husband, Anastasia made a deal with a powerful devil for the power to seek revenge on her husbands 
killers. This deal gave her immense power in return for sending souls to the devil to feast upon. The deal has greatly extended Anastasia&#39;s life span, 
but has not stopped her from aging. As a result, she has become a frail, withered old raisin of a woman. This has in no way diminished her powers 
at all, on the contrary her magics are more powerful than ever. In the service of her devil master, she has built the cult known as the &quot;Dumas Family&quot;, 
some of which are actual blood relatives and descendants, but most of which are cultists , followers and hangers-on. Her cultists cultivate the follwers 
and the best of them get innitiated into the family and the rest become sacrifices to their patron. The Family has developed an evergrowing following 
and because of Anastasia&#39;s power, keen mind and ruthlessness has made deep inroads into many local institutions including guilds, noble houses, city hall, 
the city watch and possibly even further. Because of her growing infirmity, she has predominantly become reclusive in the family home and passed all of 
the more public duties of leadership to her grandson Nickodeamus, a cocky and vicious litlle cur. However, she still performs most of the communion and
sacrificial rites to her patron herself. She spends more and more time in a fugue state communing with her patron and less and less time in lucidity. 
She is capable of great feats of magic but will almost never engage in extended combat. If she can&#39;t immediately dispatch her eneies within or before the 
first round of combat, she will summon and allow her family to do her fighting for her and use her magic to make her escape as quickly as possible. It is
unclear what her or her patron&#39;s endgame is beyond the accumulation of power and the devouring of souls, but theres no way it&#39;s good for anyone.
 </td>
      <td> Anastasia was once a fairly regular woman, perhaps a little bit rude, snobby and condescending, but nothing too exceptional. Her husband&#39;s murder at the
hands of his business rivals, left her a broken, vengeful and angry woman. Feeling helpless to get revenge on her own, she sought out ancient rites and 
made a pact with a greater devil to give herself the powers she needed. Cold, calculating and shrewed, one by one she sent her enemies souls to her patron. 
By the time she had exacted her revenge the kust for power had overcome her. As the years went by and she grew her family, she became more and more cruel
vicious and wrathful. The more time she spent communing with her patron, the less of a grip she continued to hold on reality and is now quite mad. 
Despite her madnees and her infirmity, she is still very capable, cunning and intelligent. She rules her family with an iron fist and will tolerate no
failure from her descendants or followers. She is manuipulative, and will often play members of her family against each other to get the outcome she wants.

      <td> Spartan in nature (but without the honorable intent) Orcish culture is well-known for its celebration of brute strength and denunciation of the more feminine side of an individual&#39;s nature. From birth, Beach, born 
&#39;Ukhtor&#39;, was smaller than his cohort and more inclined towards cleanliness and grace. As a baby he would cry and whine if exposed to violence or filth of any kind. Bullied and beaten often for what were perceived 
as less &#39;Orcish&#39; features, even as an infant, Ukhtor&#39;s mother feared for her son growing up in such a horrible environment. What&#39;s more, she was embarrassed to have produced such a creature. During one of the war-party&#39;s 
treks between camps, she abandoned Ukhtor in a basket by a well-traveled road just outside of the party&#39;s planned travel path. Local constables were escorting magistrates between nearby towns and cam across the 
basket. Peering inside, the head of the constabulary, Amin Carr, exclaimed, &quot;cursed Orcs! They cannot even care for their own!&quot; &quot;Do away with the filthy runt!&quot; One of the constables sneered. Amin peered into Ukhtor&#39;s 
deep blues eyes and saw a nimble, dedicated soul; much different from the ferocious hatred he&#39;d seen in his battles against raid-parties. &quot;No,&quot; Amin exclaimed, &quot;this one is different. 
And we needn&#39;t fall victim to the same virulent hatred that afflicts the Orcs.&quot; Amin brought Ukhtor with him for the journey. Staring into his sea-blue eyes he pronounced that the youngster be named &#39;Beach&#39;. 
Raised within the Constabulary&#39;s ranks, Beach learned skills more akin to his natural abilities and became an agile killer. He was also imbued with their sense of noblility and respect.
 </td>
      <td> Unlike most Orcs, Beach does his best to avoid violence. He is cultured and regal, poilte and knowledgeable in ettiquette and manners. He is a superb butler and is highly knowledgeable in culinary and serving arts.  
Ironiocally, he is also very capable when it comes to violence. He is skilled with disguise, poison and assassination and will never shy away from defending himself or his family.  </td>

seedy social circles, he connected with the Violet Conch, a high-sea slaver group who traded in peoples of any race or social class so long as it was profitable. Realizing his opportunity at wealth (and not caring that 
others would suffer) Captain Wheeler trained with the Violet Conch, learning the &#39;ropes&#39; of sailing and trading peoples as goods. The process largely wore down his moral compass. Regardless of these heavy 
experiences, Wheeler (renamed by his sailmates - his original name only known to him at this point) is well known as the &#39;beast who inspires&#39; or the &#39;spirit of the wandering sailor&#39; because of his profound fecundity with 
respect to sea-shanties. Those shanties have become even more renown because of their magical effects - often saving sailors and their ships in crisis

beleiver in chaos and will do whatever he can to stir up as much trouble as he can, whenever he can for whoever he can. His god&#39;s current plan involves him working with the Dumas Family and helping their patron achieve

her teeth would turn colors. One night she broke into a locel wine-maker&#39;s facility and stole a small barrel of wine and decanting equipment. Her parents quickly grew tired of this behavior and enrolled her in the local 
militia. Needless to say, Chloe&#39;s dichotomous attitude continued into her years of training with the militia. She enjoyed the challenge and growth but despised the regimen and boundaries. As a coping mechanism to 
bring more joy to her life, Chloe turned back to wine. She&#39;s been charged with dereliction of duty on numerous occasions. However, since her parents are high-ranking political advisors she has protection against any kind 
of discharge from her duties. Consequently, she floats through her duties during the day and returns to her passion for wine-making at night. She has a small tent outside of her family home within which she practices 
methods of decanting late into the twilight hours.

      <td> A young Dwarven boy grew up in the mining village of Duncarve. Raised in a family of &#39;second-handers&#39; - bandsmen and drags-men who would load and operate the mining carts - he was subjected to a mundane life of daily 
servitude. Load the cart. Steer the cart. Unload the cart. It was exhausting. He grew especially tired of watching the purveyors of the mine increase the quality of their lifestyle and of the increased riches of the 
merchants and oresmen who would deal in the precious materials Claideighm would cart around. Bah! He thought to himself. This is no way to live. A slave to the gold and servile to those who deal in it.
The hypermasculine environment of the mines and mercantile trading classes that frequented his family shop crept under his skin. Under his skin. That&#39;s a place he would rarely visit. When he did, he knew he was out of 
place. And not just because of his distaste for servitude. No. It was his distaste for himself. This was not who he was really meant to be. Claideighm decided to run away at an early age before he was further 
inculcated into the unescapable lifestyle and traditions of his village. He followed a merchant caravan to a nearby city and was suddenly exposed to sights and sounds, flavors and scents, skin tones and textures, that 
he&#39;d never seen before. His psyche was on fire. In a short period of time in the city Claideighm created a new narrative for himself. One that fit. He recognized that his natural figure was more attractive to the 
males of the races. He realized that sex and his hunger for it was a commodity under his control rather than under the control of some mercantile class. He redeemed his soul the moment he found and purchased his 
first runed pants and placed his slender frame in a the shadows of the streets for passing merchants to admire. His increasing androgyny worked in his favor. They exploited them for their money at every turn and began to 
identify themself as neither man nor woman.They are now well-known as one of the most charming &#39;courtesans&#39; in the major cities of the region.

of the purview of their viscious condemners. Consequently, Coalwater was raised among the many races but conditioned to remain largely out of sight. Their family was constantly plagued with the anxiety of being found 
or sold out and, as such, spent a great deal of energy ensuring that their homesteads and places of business were non-descript and secure from prying eyes. Coalwater picked up on the many innovative techniques that their 
family would use to secure themselves from potential intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they matured, Coalwater would occasionally wander the market freely yet subtly, spying for goods or peoples who might help them better secure their 
homestead. It was during one of these outings that they connected with a few roughshod members of the local Thieves&#39; Guild. Quickly becoming friends over conversations about locks and tools, these three youth began to 
investigate means of overcoming the security of local businesses and magistrates. Calling it &#39;troubleshooting&#39;, they would often come into conflict with the local guards and militia. It was during these brief skirmishes 
that the three youth decided they would take it upon themselves to contract their skills and knowledge to the local elite with the slogan, &#39;Three Geese that will honk yer horn - If we can blow it, it need be reborn&#39;.

the local sages who taught the children of minor Nobles in his home; the city of Baraithton. As an adolescent, Corrora began to have extremely vivid nightmares of himself committing terrible, violent acts. The nightmares 
progressed to the point where the previously gregarious nobleman&#39;s son turned sullen and dour. The lack of sleep caused him to be irritable, constantly snapping at his family, his tutors, and his friends. The feeling of 
isolation only made the problem worse. The nightmares because more violent, more vivid, and more frequent the more withdrawn he became. One day the nightmares became reality. A skirmish with his younger brother, Yarith 
ended in bloodshed. While wrestling, Corrora blacked out. When he came to his senses, he was holding a sharpened shard of rock with his Yarith&#39;s blood dripping from it and his brother&#39;s limp body beneath him. Dropping the 
stone in horror, Corrora was touched by the Goddess Lenterra (Goddess of arcane knowledge) for the first time. He could feel her hand reaching through him as he cradled his Yarith&#39;s head in his lap. A soft glowing light 
encompassed them both. And, Yarith breathed. That night, and for several nights after, Corrora had the same dream: he was floating above his body watching as his eyes became red with a hint of flickering fire followed by 
him reaching for a rock and slashing Yarith&#39;s throat with it. This was not the last time something like this happened to Corrora. At the suggestion of Lenterra, Corrora began to deepen his study of the arcane and religion 
in search of a cure for his condition. His natural curiosity lent itself to him becoming a renowned expert in arcane and ancient religious phenomenon. This research led him to discover that the Elvish side of his heritage 
held some deep ancient secrets. A number of his ancestors had committed despicable acts millenia ago. The acts they committed were the very acts he dreams about so vividly. The ancestors were the very ancestors who&#39;s 
spirits overcame his body when under too much stress from imminent danger. Corrora is constantly in search of a way to rid himself from his ancestor&#39;s curse. This search is what originally brought him to Eberston and the 
Yakahe frontier far from his family.

demon hiding in human form ruling over a wealthy keep. It proved to be the last raid they ever went on. The demon&#39;s forces annihilated his clan except for a few members that were kept for torturing at the demon&#39;s leasure. 
Crusible, who then went by the name Torog, was one such unlucky individual. After long months of torture, Torog was slated to be burned at the stake as one final retribution for the clan&#39;s insolence in daring to attack. 
But the fire refused to take Torog. Surrounded by flames, a higher purpose was revealed to Torog by the Gods of the Forge, and Crusible Firepeak was born. Surviving the flames Crucible fled from the demon, and found a 
forge where he could learn the trade to honour his saviours and embark on his new path. Swearing revenge against all those that inhabit the Abyss, he pursued his new calling with furvor, until he caught the eye of The 
Phantom and became the smith and weaponer for the Dead Hunters

patchy and singed. He wears full plate armor underneath the long leather apron covered in grease and scorth marks. Crusible isn&#39;t the brightest of fellows, but has become quite adept at his chosen calling of the forge. 
What he lacks in intelligence he makes up for in passion, industry and devotion to the Gods that saved him. He&#39;s not very personable, but he has proven himself to The Phantom as a stalwart ally.

priests remain largely the province of avaricious humans and elves, some warforge have proven their &#39;mettle&#39;, so-to-speak, and climbed the ranks of the clergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire population of this church are garbed in 
ridiculously lavish clothing. Cure has embraced this practice...well...religiously. Since his creation he has fervently advocated the expansion of the Empire&#39;s commerce and investments, fought valiantly alongside his 
brothers-in-faith to protect merchant caravans, and bled speech after speech upon visiting commoners about the values of donating their lands and services to the temple for the betterment of the &#39;Great Machine&#39;, as they 
call it. These abbots and priests and their followers can often be found in prayer to the Marketplace Eternal in the Outlands. Cure is a fanatical follower of High Priest Morion DeFaye and will almost always 
accompany him, whether on a trip to guard a caravan or in a ritual and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal.

      <td> Delores Dumas is the Daughter of Anastasia Dumas and mother of Nicodeamus and Irini Dumas. Delores grew up under her mother&#39;s cruel thumb and was prone to rebellion. At the age of 19 she met Saul Branstock and soon
became pregnant, giving birth to her first child, Nicodeamus. Upon his birth, he was immediately taken from her by her grandmother and Saul helped her flee from her family. Her and Saul lived happily for many years
though she always missed her son. One day a young familiar stranger arrived at their home. This stranger proceeded to put her in chains, gun down her husband and burn down their home. On their way back to the family
home Delores was horrified to learn that this cold-hearted youth was in fact, Nicodeamus, all grown up. This event was the first large blow to her sanity. Her vicious son tortued and tormented her the entire way back
to the ancestral family home. Once she was home, the family kept her locked and chained away in the basement shrine to their master. After several months chained in solitude, Anastasia offered up her daughter as tribute
to the family patron. The devil took Delores to his realm and impregnanted her, shattering her mind completely and irrivocably. Upon her return, now thoroughly mad, Delores gave birth to a daughter, half human, half
devil. Anastasia named her Irini and promised her to Nicodeamus. In her madness, the horrifying things she has experienced have also given her a kind of clarevoyance and has made her a prophet of sorts. She regularly
has vision, omens and portents of things to come and events happening far away. Because of this, the family has kept her alive and prisoner in their sanctum. Delores frequently escapes from her prison, often at the at
the expense of her own health, and often leads the rest of the family on a merry chace, but is always captured again and brought back to her prison. Anastasia also uses Delores&#39; blood as a regular offering to the family
patron, each time giving more of her soul to the master.
 </td>
      <td> Delores Dumas is always manic, disheveled and glassy-eye. Her red hair is always a mess and she is barely clothed, basically wearing a dirty gray long nightshirt. She always has her hands bound in manacles keep her from
that double any kind of magical travel, but also double as her spellcasting focus allowing her to cast spells without any other spell components. Delores is quite mad and barely coherent. In her more lucid moments she
tries to escape from her family, but is always brought back. At best, she speaks in riddles, at worst, in complete gibberish. Because of her broken mind, she cannot be charmed or contorlled in any way and is immune to
psychic damage. Delores isn&#39;t particularly aggressive, more just frantic. She will not attack anyone or anything unless she is directly attacked herself, but due to her mania, she will unwittingly cast spells such as
Tasha&#39;s Hideous Laughter, Fear, or Otto&#39;s Irresistable Dance on random targets in her vacinity. If she is directly attacked she will respond with the full force of her psychic magic. Unfortunately for her, because of
her &quot;special&quot; relationship with the Dumas Family&#39;s Patron, none of her magic has any effect on her blood relatives. Everyone else, including non-blood related family, is fair game forher power.

paths of devastation into the surrounding kingdoms. Unknown to the broader public, the Grimfang tribe has derived their ruthlessness from a desire to protect themselves from the strategic and unethical assaults of
the Northern Dwarven and Elven alliances. Separated from his tribe during a heavy skirmish, Deonne was held and tortured by the Inquisitors of the North seeking the hearth of the King of the Grimfang. Tortured over
and over without giving up any information, he was abandoned for dead. Trudging through the bitter winter landscape, he eventually found a family of traveling merchants who took pity on the cowering, shivering youth hidden
off the side of a trading route. They took him in as an adopted son. Eventually finding Solace in the Church of the Merchantile God, Deonne has since committed his life to
gaining retribution for the little known evils of the allied nations. While this serves as his over arching life-goal, he has settled himself into a rewarding juxtapositional life of providing comfort and respite to
travelers of the Realms, dwarves and elves alike, to offer the comfort and compassion that he and his peoples never received. Noble in presence, Deonne is committed to a life governed by natural law and the order
civilization brings to the masses. Although resentful of the factions responsible for the unethical treatment of his tribe, he recognizes that town and city officials must bring order for their people, and he believes that
religious factions are more capable of this than politicians and magistrates.

of court life. At 16 he left the castle in the night looking for adventure. He found it in a tavern where he met Taron. The two teenagers quickly became friends. Leaving his hometown of Oxlight behind him, the two
adventured far and wide, both starting and ending many fights along the way. During this time, the charismatic Draake convinced more adventurers to join their ranks. At 24, Draake was captured on a raid and brought back
to town. His brother, now Lord, almost didn&#39;t recognize him. Granted clemency, the two agreed to enrich each other. Trassel ensured that Draake would become the local bandit leader by sending his soldiers against
all other gangs and in return Trassel recieved a cut from every raid. Draake would keep the gang in line and would take new recruits (criminals from Oxlight) which helped lower expenses for Trassel and made him look better
to the king. This arrangement has persisted for the last 26 years.

message promoting freeing the commoners from the clutches of the royalty.

She is phenominal at her job and at the leading edge of fashion. There is somethine strange about her though. No one seems to know where she came from or when she arrrived, but whenever it was, her reputation as a 
seamstress preceeded her. For all intents and purposes and to all forms of detection, Eugenia appears to be a non-magical human, but she is in fact some sort of ancient Fey and a master artificer.

      <td> Ezio’s people were a cult who worshipped one of the Great Old Ones, a Forgotten God. His family chose this because they witnessed the fascist matriarchical hierarchy of Lollth [Or similar Evil Drow God]. Alongside this,
the tribe heard rumors and saw evidence that the Great Old Ones were on the rise to reclaim their positions of power over the material and astral planes. The great Jackal Irrt, the Lord of Hunger, Thirst, Famine, and
Drought, and Moander, the Lord of Growth and Decay [Two Forgotten Gods] are separately surging forward into the hearts and minds of those in the underdark and those few clans who wander the middle-ground between the
upperworld and the Underdark. Disaffected with fascist rulers, Ezio&#39;s tribe rejected and became fervent enemies of the ruling pantheons of the Underdark. Learning of the power and promise of the Forgotten Gods, Ezio&#39;s
clan began offering faith and tithings to Ommen-Hurr [A different Forgotten God], the goddess of Shadow and Time. Because of their growing size and relative power, other apostatic clans who followed other Old Gods
became violent towards Ezio&#39;s tribe. One fateful night, the followers of Irrt summoned aspects of the deity to the material realm to strike. Massive jackals with gnashing teeth and almost rotted skin hanging loosely from
their frames were unleashed on Ezio&#39;s village. Demon hounds descended on the Underground city of Daur’zzwth (Dar-zooth) [or any Drow or Underdark village] that Ezio and his people called home. One of these great
demon hounds sought out Ezio’s father and uncle especially, invaded their home, and assaulted the family. Ezio’s father, Ziirr’kho (Zee-rick-oh) and uncle Ras’klnn (Raz-kill- non) bravely fought the beast, bringing it
near death, yet both Drow heroes were left close to death themselves. A young Ezio, terrified and protecting the youth in the basement of the home, silently dashed out of the cellar trap-door to grasp his father’s powerful
shortsword. The demon hound circled, smelling victory, and, due to injury and pride, did not sense Ezio lurking in the shadows around the outside of the room. Drooling and snapping its jaws in naïve glee, the beast slowly
approached the two men. Ezio leapt from the shadows and sunk the blade deep into the beasts eye, killing it. He’s since been a family hero. The tribe has taken it upon themselves to train him as an Assassin and Diplomat
and send him forth into the Upperworld to cause chaos and make way for their rise to power.

      <td> The Dwarven village of Harrmuth is located in a largely isolated hilly region on the island of Er Kaal, known for its violent weather, broad chasms, and random volcanic activity. Er Kaal is also known for its wandering
arcanists of multiple races, casters who enjoy toying with the fabric of reality and the genetic heritage of various populations&lt;/p&gt;Although having a residing town council, Harmuth is under the control of the nearby
Dwarven Kingdom of Ephronisia; a city renown for its rich legacy of heroicism, regality, craftsmanship, and innovation. Fatoumata&#39;s family were Harmuth&#39;s resident diplomats, placed there to keep watch over the town and
help govern its people. As such, she was raised in an environment rich with political banter, charity, arts, and intellectual aspiration. This formed young Fatoumata&#39;s personality and her pursuit of all that is good and
excellent. Harmuth and other nearby villages were often the target of wandering arcanists looking to experiment with their magicks. One fateful morning while young Fatoumata wandered out to the mills to revel in
their comradery and craftsmanship, a hole tore open in the ground before her and began spouting viscous black liquid like an overflowing bottle of carbonated tar. The tar gathered into a face, a gnarled old dwarf of
impossibly ugly visage. It spoke to her. &quot;You. You are my daughter.&quot; A growling and scraping voice boomed, &quot;and you are the opposable one. The one that will gain the leverage I need!&quot; At which point the
grotesque face of tar proceeded to spout the vile bilious black liquid towards her. Both hands were doused in the black goo as she put them up to guard her face, closing her eyes tight out of instinct. When
Fatoumata opened her eyes, the fountain of black goo was gone. But the hole remained. She looked around quickly to see if anyone, a spellcaster or demon, was responsible for this encounter, and she saw nothing but the
plains between her village and lumber mills. &quot;Look to your hands, my child. My daughter,&quot; a voice rang in her head. She looked down at her hands. Black goo was covering both but quickly evaporated once
her gaze found its target. She was left with an incredible sight. A second opposable thumb on each hand. Wondering if she&#39;d imagined the event, she wandered back to the village to show her family. Suspiciously, her
father would dodge any questions about the events and her mother would quiet her. Upon doing her own limited research, she discovered that her family has indeed had encounters with various powerful entities in the past
and now wonders if one of these entities are responsible for her &#39;difference&#39;. As the years passed, Fatoumata became something of both a celebrity and a pariah. People of her town and surrounding Dwarven empire were
both fascinated and terrified of her &#39;difference&#39;. She has learned to adapt to this through disguise; carrying party masks with her and wearing beautiful gloves that distract from the &#39;difference&#39; and draw peoples&#39;
attention to their ornate appearance instead.

producing and grooming the finest pigs anyone had seen. Perhaps they worked with such fervor because they sought to clear the dirt off the name &#39;Goblin&#39;. Perhaps they toiled so hard because they just loved pigs that much.
Who knows? Doesn&#39;t matter to Fot. All that matters to Fot is that the pigs are healthy, smooth, and with that perfect shade of pink that makes you kiss your fingers and say, &quot;muah&quot;. Pigs weren&#39;t their only trophies.
Fot&#39;s family also produce what they believe to be the finest Folla Tubers and Gum Beans in the region, among other vegetables. With a staunch work ethic and a kind and respectful attitude uncommon from Goblins directed
towards the merchants and traders of the nearby villages and cities, Fot and his family have established a stable standard of living. But not without further hard work. Little Fot continues his daily 16 hour grind to and
from trading centers and market squares as a purveyor of fine livestock and farmed goods. He is also a committed competitor in the bi-annual pig competition, &quot;Cochonatico&quot;, and has numerous ribbons and trophies to show-off.

change is life.&quot; He patted Gleandric on the back while Cujuloa continued stripping a large Bison of it&#39;s hide. Gleadric became two spirits inhabiting one physical body. Cujuloa was largely in charge of his daily productive
activities - invoking dreams in his waking life and providing soft, warm dreams to his peoples - while Gleadric remained in control of his interactions with his community. However, Cujuloa demanded that they take their
firm beliefs in equality and profound spirituality to the civilized communities and that they find new means and ways to bring peoples back to the basic love of for flora and fauna. They believe that by building room in
the market for impressive hide and fur trade - a return to more primitive and anarchic ways - while impressing the importance of adhering to dreams over the purported reality of the waking world; that this will bring
peoples back to their essential being. Their goals, along with their split psyche, make social appearances, well, a challenge in situations relying on a finely detailed social contract. They come across to most as
wild or &#39;crazy&#39;, but upon closer inspection and interactions, their distilled spirituality leaves a mark of genuine good. Depending on which spirit is taking charge, they refer to themselves in 3rd person - either
Gleadric or Cujulo.

Jhandoo Marr - multiple settlements within the crags of the Eastern Fingers - are connected by various rope bridges and pulley trams. The populations of these villas combined the Halfling aptitude for creating fine
clothes, textiles, and foods with Hill Dwarf expertise with gemology, metallurgy, and construction. Not only has this alliance produced goods of wondrous value to the region but also unique individuals with a new
mix of talents that the Realms have not yet seen. The mixing of minds had generated a large population of peoples with psionic abilities. Growing up in this culturally rich and diverse environment, Glem&#39;s psionics grew
quickly, as did his recognition of the evolution of personal identity as an avenue for personal gain. He was able to see into peoples&#39; minds and personal identities and quickly gather the worth of identity to each
individual, to each merchant, to the Bureau, and beyond. He thought to himself often, if the Bureau of Population Control can mete out fees and fines for not having proper documents to prove who you are and what
blood flows through your veins, then any of us can jump in on that process and, say, sift off a few coins here and there. With the proper expertise, of course. And it wasn&#39;t long before he sought training from the
local guild of Identity Traders; a faction dedicated to undermining the controls imposed by the Bureau. It was here that he perfected his skills at forgery, made connections within the community, and grew his notoriety as
the &#39;go-to&#39; for illegal documents required for trade, travel, and more.

      <td> Glohrimoore is a smith, born and bred, but not what one might imagine from a hard-working Mountain Dwarf. While fully committed to his Deity, Moradin [Any central Dwarven Deity], he sees the forge more so in terms of its
dependence upon fire and light. As a youngster, he was always fascinated with the forging processes, but his attention was more focused on how fire and light were the central mechanism for the greatest creations. He
turned his attention away from weapon and armor crafting and instead towards the construction of the finest lanterns for travellers, city streets, and beyond.

      <td> Glotys had a simple and genuine upbringing by a Dwarven family in love with the wilderness. They lived in a small village on the outskirts of the great hill Dwarf Empire of Ualen [any major Dwarven Empire] renown for
their generosity in supplying the rest of the realm with forged goods, gems, and precious ores. Her peoples&#39; passion for what wealth and goods lay within the hills did not appeal to her. Instead, Glotys took a liking to
the nature above ground. The blooming of flowers and how their pollenation by bees rejeuvenated the life that flourished above ground. Her passion for bees was so profound that as she learned more and more about the
ecology of her surroundings the busy little insects were drawn to her. Her hard work and staunch dedication to learning more of her surroundings were rewarded with certain magicks that enable her to communicate with the
tiny pollenators and call on them for help. These moments inspired her to begin an endeavour to provide housing and even greater love and support to these important components of the ecosystem.

his life. The Shaman of his tribe, an Orog, held sacred texts that detailed rituals for contacting the population of the Feywild. Golomir gained her favor and studied these texts until he was finally able to contact the
practitioners of the archfey.Golomir gained access to the fey realms and wandered there, befriending many of its denizens and adopting their medicines, attitudes, magicks, and lore. He grew his talents as a forager of
medicinal herbs and a practitioner of critical care. What&#39;s more, he adopted the archfey practice of creating bobbles and dolls to represent that which he believes to be good in the world. Over time, while the Seelie
taught him the ways of the wild in both the mortal and fey realms, Golomir gradually grew the curled ram horns that distinguish him from the rest of the members of the Orcish race.He now splits his time between the two
realms wandering with the aim of bringing joy to those he meets. Well known for his abilities as a &#39;cunning man&#39; or &#39;hedge wizard&#39;, a sort of shamanic voodoo medicine practitioner, he believes that joy and the greater
good is only achievable through spreading health and literacy.

Enter Cruda. A young halfing woman who loved a good slice of Sylvan Nut Bread with Apple butter for breakfast every morning, followed by a tart Flumberry Danish and a good swig of Pine Brew Cider to wash it all
down. Her love for pastries and breads meant that she spent most of her time at the local bakery interacting with the baker and all of her staff. Slowly but surely, Gruda learned the trade. Along the way she also
uncovered new methods of growing grains to produce different colors and textures. The innovation was so spectacular for the shop and the trade in general that the people nicknamed her, &quot;Wheatsheaf&quot;. Gruda longed to
spread the joy of baked goods to the rest of the realm. She took the coin she earned for her innovation and purchased a small home in the nearby city of PinionMast [Any major trade City]. She gleefully carted her supplies
and goods to the markets of PinionMast. Upon arriving in town to offer her fine baked goods it seemed there was little to no competition. Gruda had a corner on the tastiest baked goods around. She longs to open her very
own shop one day.

the contacts he made through his brief schooling, he created his current personae and opened his curiosity shop. Most of the goods he carries are minor magic trinkets of no real use to anyone, but he also carries
and extensive stock of materials used for the various schools of spellcasting. From holy symbols to spellbook materials, Hercule&#39;s carries it all. Now and again, he does actually manage to procure some useful magic items
for sale, but those are few and far between.

Abandoning her in a marketplace when she was barely into her teen years certainly didn&#39;t help with any of these damages. In order to survive, she took up the first available opportunity to support herself - a role
as boatswain on a questionable ship of ne&#39;er-do-wells. Over the course of a number of voyages, she realized these &#39;sailors&#39; were second-rate pirates who would plunder minor textile and fabric shipments or something of
equally laughable financial gain. The crew were, surprisingly, abusive - especially with her - and her disorders compounded. Fatter and drunker, Hylinn returned to land-based civilization as a quarter of half the person
she might have been. But not without the Captain of the crew plucking out her right eye as a prize and also a punishment for abandoning the ship. Taking up various custodial and service jobs wherever she could in
order to survive, or, rather, subsist, Hylinn focused most of her frustrations into her love for a good drunk and fatty foods. Her numerous disorders, perhaps too many to count, helps haughty and self-centered patrons feel
better about themselves and thus drives a decent amount of business to the barstools in the tavern at which she works - &quot;the Dull Dragoon&quot;.

restaurants around town eventually achieving the position of Maitre D at the most prestigious restaurant in the region. He is extremely good at his job and very attentive to his highest priority guests. This serves
two purposes for him; First it insures that he is tipped well and develops return customers, and secondly, it allows him to eavesdrop on his important guest, gather their secrets, and handsomely supplement his income by
selling those secrets to the local thieve&#39;s guild where they can be put to good use by the underworld.

He handles all political dealings and negotiations between the family and any outside institution, be they governments, businesses or other organizations. Jedediah sits on the city council as well as the boards 
and committees of several other institutions including the City Watch. He will always negotiate to the benefit of the family and attempt to influence any organization he is apart of to do his family&#39;s work for them. 
Jedediah has also been charged as the primary caregiver for his beloved sister Delores and dotes on her as often as his other responsibilties allow. He is not happy with the horrors that have been wrought on his dear 
sister, but he understands that they needed to happen for the good of the family. He is, however, very unhappy with how Nicodeamus abuses and tortures his mother. He, in fact, does not like much of what Nicodeamus does, 
who he is or the decisions he has made for the family and believes that Anastasia should have put him in charge instead of his demented nephew. While he would never make an outright play for leadership, especially while 
Anastasia is still alive, he has been building his own power base in case the day should ever come. Above all else, he will do anything in his power to protect Delores.

      <td> In the town of Barrelheist [Seaside town or city] people are always astir because of the constant influx of supply and trade ships and the endless queue of traders and merchants hoping to be the first to acquire exotic
goods. When the diaspora of hill Gnomes of Aznmott [Distant and Disappeared Gnomish City] were driven from their home by a string of massive experiments gone awry, they arrived to settle among the hills and valleys
surrounding Barrelheist. These gnomes were instinctively drawn to the tradeport and quickly began to make up a large proportion of the population. Among this growing frontier shanty marketplace grew a remarkably talented
gnome who shows great promise with steam technology, Kaz Lamosatzi. Kaz&#39; family was unorthodox in all possible ways. They rarely had a stable home and instead would simply have meeting spaces where they would
reconvene after hard-working days of scavenging for materials to develop their steam inventions. What&#39;s more, the family unit was not traditional and instead consisted of non-hierarchical extended family and friends.
Family structure is so diffuse among these Hill Gnomes that it&#39;s rare a member can identify a proper &#39;mother&#39; or &#39;father&#39;. Instead they are most drawn to whatever individual inspires invention! Kaz cultivated his capacity
for invention and steam technology and his gadgets gained popularity among the sailors and merchants of Barrelheist. Always chipper and looking for the good in things, Kaz successfully disguises a certain disdain for
wealthy people that he acquired living much like an urchin in a shanty town frequented by the noble and affluent.

      <td> Krapp was born to devout kubernetic zealots in the gnomish Emerald Mines. His youth was spent weaving elaborate pods, praying to cluster, and seeking out and tagging dangerous monoliths in the Emerald Mines. Upon his
Evanescence, Krapp discovered human food, and after eating lobster, swore he would never eat &quot;cave fish&quot; again. Learning to read and write common during his Evanescence, Krapp began to write plays for small traveling
troupes that would pay a pittance for a weird, disconnected sequence of garbage cans and bleakness.  When his parents asked him what he actively sought in life, he said: &quot;Nothing.&quot;  His parents misunderstood what he meant.
Krapp&#39;s seeking continued as he submitted plays to the human royal troupe for Her Majesty.  His plays were all rejected (mainly because the Queen believes in Something, Anything, Everything, but not Nothing). Along the
way, Krapp came into posession of the Ansible of Time at a cast party.  He traded a live lobster for it, and began recording his journal, along with a newsreel of historical events, every day for the remainder of his
unsuccessful life. Currently, Krapp is middle-aged, and his unhappiness, his mistakes, his missed opportunities, the love of his life with scratches on her legs from a gooseberry bush, are all captured in the Ansible.
So, too, are all local events. In his attic apartment, Krapp has numerous rolls of cheap, hairy goatskin parchment, on which he has penned his strange, apocalyptic plays.  His attic is also littered with black, slippery
banana peels, and fruit flies are his flatmates, even in winter.
 </td>
      <td> Krapp is a sad sack of a gnome. He writes and he drinks and he sulks, in a downward spiral of meloncholy. He has managed to keep an accurate history of the surrounding region for decades, but seems reluctant to share it
with anybody. His plays and poetry on the other hand, he&#39;s more than happy to share, as terrible as it is.

brood were also skilled sea-men. His clan claim to be descendents of the original weretigers and remain staunchly noble in their dealings with others with the hopes of changing public opinion towards lycanthropes.
Kraven set forth on such an information campaign but was met with rebukes and violence. His lycanthropic form was incredibly dangerous in defence of many violent altercations, many of which unfortunately resulted in
murders. Kraven thus turned his hand to what was in his heart: sailing, artwork, shadows, magic, mystery, and music. Combining these passions, Kraven is one of the first and only tattoo artists in the region who can
offer magic tattoos - at a costly price.

      <td> The high elves of the Northern Expanse have remained stoic in their pursuit of peace with the surrounding Nations. This is exemplified in their various treatises. Hailing from this environment sounds near idyllic and its
peoples destined for greatness in politics. Well, perhaps only half of this is true. Over her 150 years, for sure, Libil has achieved political prominence in the regional Merchants&#39;s Guild. She has been an important
figure in the negotiations between the various increasingly expanding trading companies that threatened to put a stranglehold on individual merchants. Libil established, nearly single-handedly, the regulations for these
companies and the available guilds for the individual merchants on the ground. Libil&#39;s upbringing among the purportedly peaceful High Elves should bespeak the formation of a law-abiding character. Her knowledge of
their inner-workings led her astray from this destiny. Instead, Libil learned that the High Elves, out of survival or desperation, had been conducting various unethical surgical strikes against surrounding Nations;
unethical because they betrayed the expectations of the treatises and were kept out of the public eye. This led Libil to pursue the art of inquisition, of unearthing the truth of a situation, and drove her in a
long-standing bid as High Journeyman of the Regional Thieves&#39; Guild. Instead of abiding by laws that seemed to only mask the horrible truths that underpin the appearance of peace, She seeks to achieve true peace and
stability for &#39;boots on the ground&#39; through the unionization structures that guilds bring. She can often be found in the busiest marketplaces of large towns and cities, directing traffic, solving squabbles, and
enlisting merchants to join the guild (both Merchants&#39; and Thieves&#39; (the latter often referenced, instead, as &#39;Workers&#39; Guild&#39;, or &#39;Commoners&#39; Association&#39;, or something of that ilk)

Cal&#39;s mind tumbled through what he thought were memories but wouldn&#39;t stop tumbling. He was getting dizzy. Stop tumbling! He cried out in his mind. He stumbled into a clearing in the woods where ruined buildings from a
long razed village jutted out of the landscape like giant skeletal fingers reaching for the freedom of the sky. Is this where I was headed? Cal looked about. Seemed like a place that one might look for. He set up a
makeshift camp, chewed down some jerky and tack, and grabbed himself a nice sleep. Upon waking, Cal&#39;s mind filled with wonder and glee that he had found what he had been searching for. This is it! But why was I searching
for this place? Cal searched the area further only to find burnt Firbolg bones and burnt equipment. They did it again! They silenced us. We mustn&#39;t allow this! He thought to himself. His mind turned inward upon itself.
All his memories of living and growing up in a regal Firbolg village became muddled together with his recent explorations. He couldn&#39;t discern the difference and instead concluded that he must be the last of his royal
line that some mysterious force seeks to end. No. I cannot allow it. I must find our sacred land. Our true Kingdom. The only way is to connect with those who claim royal positions here in this region and beyond. I must
rebuild our people. Crazy Cal made his was through the tangled forests to the nearest town and began his meager political campaign to recharge his royal line. Although he is not consciously aware of his Firbolg clan&#39;s
monastic heritage, his muscle memory and reflexive training are embedded within him. A contradiction, this Firbolg monk is loud and brazen.

begun in taverns that travel mouth to mouth across vast distances. Some have heard that Lovecarp is the lineage of royalty while others have spun tales of their own about his humble beginnings. His regal garb dirtied from
travels confuses people. This is perhaps his goal. Nobody but Lovecarp himself truly knows. Traveling town to town crafting new stories and refining old, he gleefully shares his narrations with every listener with very
little resistance. At the first hint of his gripping voice, most of those in the vicinity grab a tankard and sit down for one of the best stories they will hear for miles and miles. Well aware that racial tensions
not only fuel wars but also economic splendour, Lovecarp&#39;s stories almost exclusively revolve around if not at the very least include complex layers of peoples&#39; fears of those who are not like them - the &#39;Other&#39;.

      <td> Born to a salt miner mother and an accountant father, Stella grew up in a comfortably middle-class salt dwarf home with 4 brothers. Stella&#39;s mother instilled a solid sense of self-reliance and fearlessness toward male
dwarves.  She fought hard and dirty as a child, quickly gaining reputations first as a dwarf girl not to be messed with, and later, as a bully to be feared. Along the way, though she rebelled against her father, running
away from home on a number of occasions, she still acquired, through blood or through osmosis, his vigilance with money. Emerging from the salt mines fairly young for a dwarf, Stella worked numerous positions for
several years: earning her keep as baker, chimney sweep, quartermaster, governess, and personal accountant to the wild son of a lesser member of gold dwarf nobility. Stella and the wild son of the noble dwarf eloped and
were married in a kubernetic horizontal pod ceremony (which is unrecognized by dwarf law, though the noble family was oblivious to this fact in their outpouring of rage). The wild son&#39;s brothers chased Stella and the
wild son from town to town for months, until they landed in a small inland port town, and the brothers lost the scent. Stella joined the local &quot;seamstresses&quot; to pay for her husband&#39;s wild ways. One day, drunk on
cherry brandy, he shot her in the leg with a crossbow bolt. The local barber amputated Stella&#39;s leg.  Her clientele expanded rapidly, as word got out about &quot;that crazy peg lady who will do anything you want&quot; (including
acts involving her peg leg). The wild son has not been seen since the day of Stella&#39;s amputation. Several years later, Stella opened her own house of &quot;seamstresses&quot; high on a hilltop surrounded by the homes of
the wealthy and powerful.  As a seamstress, she has been in the pockets of most of the town&#39;s elite, including the constabulary who hound her continually for unpaid taxes. Stella&#39;s mansion on the hill is widely regarded
to be the classiest brothel in town, and is of some repute even several towns down the road.  She keeps her ladies fit and gorgeous, and trains them in upper class etiquette, psychology and identifying peculiar fetishes.
Though Stella is no longer active as a &quot;seamstress&quot; herself, she still hears every item of upper class news, gossip, and secrets that there is to hear.  Stella knows everything about just about every wealthy and/or noble
man in town.  She is always happy to gossip, though she does also know the value of a thing, and she knows when to charge, and how much to charge.

Mammoon sought power over everything else and would be ruthless in this pursuit. She sought the faith of her village, the surrounding region, and eventually the Underdark. Vying for a position as Loxxed Priestess,
comparable to a magistrate, Mammoon watched as her competitor gained greater and greater favor. This favor grew as her competitor finally had a child. This Duergard tribe had a particularly hard time reproducing and this
was a sign from their God. Not only did she face ongoing abuse from her husband about her barren womb, Mammoon now faced imminent defeat in her pursuit of power. As the almost Spartan culture would allow, Mammoon
snatched the child from its bed and brought it to the center idol of Clax, ringing the town bell. Many of her tribe flooded the streets to watch Mamoon sacrifice the child in offering to Clax. The statue reached down,
scooped up the body, and consumed it violently. Mammoon was then imbued with an overwhelming sense that she was destined for greater things. She denounced the tribe in an animal growl and fled the Underdark in search of
greater sacrifices to Clax. Seeing such violence in sacrifice has become her primary goal.

so &quot;by the book&quot;. Her unorthodox method ruffled many a feather in the ranks of the guard and city watch, as did her willingness to investigate any case till its conclusion. Even if that conclusion was her superiors, city
or church officials. One such investigation involving several missing children pointed to a local temple and she was murdered for her trouble. Thuse is a Revenant. Returning from the dead with a mandate to find and save
missing children, and to hunt and reek vengeance on child killers. In the meantime, she takes any cases she finds interesting to pass the time and pay the bills.

Any case she takes, she will doggedly persue it to its end regardless of the cost. She is tired. As a revenant, she has been around for a comparatively long time for a human, and the years are beginning to wear away at her.
Despite the fact that she no longer ages, you can see the years deep in her eyes. Thuse is not the most personable of people, and at her age, most of the people she ever considered friends are long gone for one reason or
another. She is however, very well connected and a lot of people owe her favors. Her mandate as a revenant, does give her a sepcial kind of bond with children, and if she is working on a case involving kids, she is
especially dogged and obsessive. Thuse is very witty and very jaded and her sarcasm has a bit of a bite. She is also a keen negotiator and will only take jobs that pay especially well or the genuinely spark her interest.
Unlike many revenants, she does not have one specific creature or individual involved with her goal, just a general goal to protect or revenge lost children, as such, she has no idea what will be the case that will
eventually be her last, but at this point, she hopes it&#39;s soon.

As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn&#39;t occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice). While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required). Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind&#39;s space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts Dispel Magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action. Once you conjure the mind, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.&quot;, &quot;Master Scrivner&quot;=&gt;&quot;whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell&#39;s power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest. You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill&quot;, &quot;One with the Word&quot;=&gt;&quot;your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore. Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook&#39;s mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll&#39;s total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren&#39;t enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points. Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spell book. Once you use this reaction, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a long rest&quot;}]}]}] </td>

which can only be achieved by relying on the power of wealth as the primary feature for division. To these clergy, trade of coin and goods is central to maintaining law and order and, as such, the church has dedicated
champions to protecting marketplaces, caravans, and any other vectors for the spread of capitalism. They have established powerful &#39;armies&#39; of warrior abbots and priests, adorned in lush tunics of grey and white highlighted
with rare coins sewn into the fabrics. Morion has spent his many years dedicated to this clergy. Battling surrounding nations as a warrior priest, He has gained notoriety for his ruthlessness and divinely imbued
abilities. Even within the hierarchy. These clergy literally battle one on one for advancement to the upper echelons. And Morion has gained a reputation as a dangerous opponent and dedicated member of the community.
The upper clergy consist primarily of Elves and Humans while the lower echelons are made up of the same plus a large proportion of Warforged created by gifted High Elf and Human devout. When he is not engaged in complex
rituals and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal at the Mercantile Temple, Morion is most often found escorting high-value trade caravans through distant trade routes. He is often accompanied by a small battalion of warforged
dedicated to the mercantile clergy. Morion is quite fond of one particular follower, Cure.

this lesson due to being surrounded by his retinue of Warforged that have insullated him from the conseuences of his overconfidence. He is unquestioningly and unwaiveringly devoted to his religion which has lead him to
look down on lesser people, the poor, and the &quot;savages&quot; of societies that aren&#39;t completely devoted and organized around commerce.

It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery Tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its Nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space. For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don&#39;t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the Location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that Location.

Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable Objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an Effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted.

      <td> Mykos grew up in the Underdark with his tribe of Tieflings. His father, Rophelos, was the Khan and his mother, Mytha, a Queen of their kind. As war among the denizens of the Underdark continued to rage, his tribe ceased to
worship thier traditional gods in favor of one of the old forgotten gods; Kezef, The Hound of Rot. As his tribe delved deeper into the following of Kezef, their raids became ruthless. Killing and wanton destruction for the
sake of killing and wanton destruction. The also bagan taking prisoners to use as slaves. This didn&#39;t sit well with Mykos as he had always had a pronounced sense of fairness and justice. When he brought his concerns to his
parents he was forced to fight his older brother Rophelor to the death in single combat. Mykos defeated his brother, but refused to deliver the killing blow. Mykos then escaped from his tribe, finding his way out of the 
Undrdark, taking himself into exile. Shortly after leaving the Underdark, he found a lone Half-Orc named Ordic and an exiled Drow, Etzio, and the three outcasts set out on the road of adventure, gaining fame and fortune 
over the years, becoming known as &quot;The Forgotten&quot;. Using their new found wealth to buy a tavern, settling in the small shanty town of Phandalin, and opening Ardenthal&#39;s Rest. Recently his Brother Rophelor came back into 
his life, now also exiled from their tribe and escorted by, much to Mykos&#39; surprise, a daughter that Mykos had never known existed.

      <td> Mykos is average height but built like a brick wall of muscle. He has deep red skin, lang black hair and short-cropped beard. He has white eyes and thick curled horns like a ram. He wears short cut pants (pants of holding)
with his long muscular tail hanging out the back above his hoofed feat. He also wears the trophies of his triumphs, A necklace of troll teeth, the thick, red, woolen cloak of a fallen Red Wizard and the blood-soak hat of a 
slain redcap over top of the specially-made helmet that fits around his horns. He also has a large tattoo of a naked lady on his left arm. Mykos is gruff, intimidating and impetuous, often acting without thinking and 
barrelling headlong into danger, despite his acute danger sense. Once battle commences though, there are few more violent, cunning and aggressive. Despite his tendency towards violence, Mykos also has a keenly developed 
sense of fairness and justice. He also has a strong aversion to authority in general, but specifically to the tenets and intervenions of the many gods of the realm. He also has a special distatse for slavers, and a 
genuine hatred of the Red Wizards of Thay in particular. He has also been known to go out of his way to provoke any authority figure that crosses his path, especially those who see him as lesser.

swamp navigation and eventually in how to navigate the more shallow seas that surrounded the Wastelands. An ambitious young man, he dreamed of a life on the seas. But he knew this wouldn&#39;t be possible within the confines
of his tribe. Although he tried his hands at engineering various war machines for his tribe and was actually quite talented at it, this couldn&#39;t possibly compare to his dreams of living a life on the high-seas.
Although he loved his people, he loved the sea more. After yet another unecessarily violent raid by his tribe on a sea-side frontier town they made there way back towards the black swamps they deemed their home. Nagata was
dismayed. He took a quick look around at the crew, made a broad and clearly unsuspicious gesture towards the starboard bow of the ship and whistled clearly (a known call for his shipmates) and then made a deliberate and
unnoticeable dash to the port side of the ship diving off quietly into the water. Nagata swam to shore unnoticed and sat on his knees. He ran his fingers through the sand, muttering, &quot;dear sea, you have me&quot;.

has the scars to prove it. Having lost so much and so many, she is reluctant to let anyone new into her life. Between her adventuring and the war, she has found many passes through places that few have ever found their way
through and marked the trails in her clan colors. She is an expert guide and always happy to get out of Seagate into the wilderness, even if it means guiding strangers to their destination. Before the war, she was a
follower of the goddess Kamsa and a member of her order, but the likeness of her goddess now bares to much of a resemblance to the Eldrazi Titans for her to have any faith left. She has abandoned her order but still
maintains the skills she has learned and has translated them into her daily life as a guide and adventurer
 </td>
      <td> Nahkirin lives a life of adventure. She much prefers the wildness of the wilderness to the confines of civilization. The more adventure the better, whatever it takes to keep her mind off of everything shes been through.
She is exceptionally skilled at climbing and the traditional Kor skill of Line-Slinging, is very proud of her skill and will not hesitate to brag about her prowess. She is generally not keen on people and will avoid making
attachments as much as possible. She has lost faith in her order. She does her best to hide it, but she is definitely haunted by the things she saw and did during the war

The true backstory of this character is up to the DM. Is this character somehow connected to your party or the BBEG? 
|
were they in a romantic partnership with a necromancer or Lich and when they died, their partner did everything they could to bring them back? 
Were they a warlock that made a deal with their patron? After they died did the patron put their soul into a machine for them to continue to serve? Are those memories actually their own, or are they being manipulated? 
|
There are so many possibilities, that I wouldn&#39;t feel right cementing only one background for this character. Adjust as needed for your own campaign.

      <td> The jungle trading port of Ambor Maala [Any Mixed Race Trading port in a jungle environment] was host to most of the races of the realms and, alongside this, most of the arcane magicks and knowledges one would expect from a
diverse population. This vibrant locale held within its confines a collection of written lore that is well known even beyond the region. Keepers of this knowledge are revered. A modest and composed Firbolg named Wesley
Palaxian had gained esteem as head keeper of these lore and the large volume of tomes within which the knowledges were held. One fateful afternoon the library of Ambor Maala was invaded by a small group of elite Drow
Soldiers and their commander, a powerful evocation/transmutation mage of the Underdark seeking greater knowledges of the arcane that were contained within the library. Wesley was far from a warrior of any sorts but knew
that in the wrong hands these knowledges would prove destructive for his home town and beyond. Valiantly defending the library, Wesley was mortally wounded. During what he believed were his final breaths he confidently
cursed the Drow and their leader. &quot;Foolish furbag,&quot; the Drow mage condesdendingly muttered unimpressed. &quot;There is clearly nothing you can do to stop us. Might as well be a monkey following the filthy jungle 
peoples you hold so dear.&quot; The mage uttered some mystical incantation in Drow and traced sigils in the air, transforming Wesley into an Orangutan. The invaders then proceeded to ignite the shelves of books in the library
before fleeing through a teleportation portal. The local guard attended the blaze and brought it under control but Wesley had already pulled himself from the blaze. Ashamed to ever show himself to anyone in his home
town, he slowly retreated into the jungle. For days, Wesley sought out the Sylvan Elven Druids he knew inhabited the surrounding jungles. Eventually found by these kinds souls, Wesley was no longer able to communicate
besides pointing to himself and shouting, &#39;Ook!. When the Druids found him reading through their tomes during his recovery, they recognized that this &#39;monkey&#39; was beyond ordinary. They chose to transport him to the High
Elven City of Emnius [A Major Elven City] for study. The Elves of Emnius were able to determine that Ook was a victim of magicks but the polymorph spell was of unknown origin to them and they weren&#39;t able to trace the magic
to uncover his original form. They quickly came to see Ook&#39;s ability to categorize and organize tomes of knowledge and appointed him as assistant to their keeper of archives and knowledge. Ook has since become renown
throughout the surrounding regions.

down as to not be so prevalent. She dresses in soft stylish leather armor covered by a long lab coat. Having been away from her tribe for a long time Orica is well aware of the way that the world views her people
and because of this she has become jaded and guarded in her interations with others. She is fierce and driven to accomplish her goal. Anyone who questions her intent or ability is met with hostility and indignance. 
She jealously guards her research and while she enjoys the benefits that the Collegium has to offer, she fears that Oswald Vardklemp and Gerhardt Klippstein want to steal her work (they don&#39;t).

visitor was Ral Zarek, Guildmaster of the Izzet League from the plane of Ravnica, and renouned Planeswalker. Master Zarek spoke to Oswald and regaled him with tales of the Izzet and their great world-altering scientific 
discoveries back on Ravnica and convinced Oswald of the merits of creating a consortium of ideas and opening a permanent channel of communication with the Izzet League. Oswald then set about, with some financial aid 
from the Izzet, bulding Collegium compounds in most major cities throughout the world and inviting prominent artificers, mages and scientists to join, learn, work and share. He continues to function as the leader and 
spokesman for the Collegium while continuing his own research and development.

interupted. He is also known to be fairly reckless when testing his new devices and contraptions and now and again manages to do some significant damage to Collegium compounds and the surrounding cities with 
out of control inventions. He has kept the indentity of of the Collegium&#39;s benefactors and their exraplanar origins to himself, but meets quarterly at secret location with Ral Zarek to maintain communication 
channels.

      <td> Life in the gnomish city of Aberash Caandu is always lively - filled with tinkerer products wobbling about and wondrous inventions that would amaze even the most experienced traveler. The gnomes of this city have always
been accepting of all other races and inter-racial marriage and offspring are not uncommon. Portius is a product of this accepting community and raised in their meticulously productive and innovative cultural practices.
Knowing from their youth that they were not only a mixed-race person but also gender fluid, Portius presents powerful qualities of both masculinity and femininity. With close-cut cropped hair and a muscular, broad build,
they seem tomboyish. Yet their graceful hands and attention to details - in their work, appearance, and environment - reflect a feminine edge. As they matured, they took on the best of each race. They chose not to
tinker, per se, at least not with &#39;inventions&#39; but instead with the biology of peoples. They took to the role of a doctor easily and quickly became the community&#39;s go-to for anything that would ail them. They also picked
up on the talents of the local Dwarven community and learned the sophisticated methods of rectification - distilling and producing fine spirits. In addition, their skills with a sharp edge and attention to detail leant
themselves well to barbering. Portius was and is seen as something of a pragmatic polymath. The wonderful outcome of the mixing of Gnomish and Dwarven genetics and culture. Portius has since set out on their own to
pursue a greater good among the regions. She has settled in the city of Tyrwind [any large city] where they have set up a sturdy shack on the outskirts of the market. Their small shop operates as an underclass clinic. Here
she also distills and bottles fine spirits for sale to taverns, inns, and the public. She has a brand called, &quot;Moorehouse&#39;, made up of various rums and whiskeys. Portius has since joined the regional Doctors&#39; Guild,
which has a small population of members. They have also been a founding member of the Rectifiers&#39; guild. Both to protect practitioners of little-known and rarely practiced professions. They seek to use their membership to
these guilds to push them to dismantle - through strategically intellectual and political means - the mercantile churches. Because of these goals, she is currently a target of Morion DeFaye and his clergy. Although these
mercantile abbots would never outright assassinate anyone, they keep close watch over her operations. Although very gender fluid in their performance of gender, Portius&#39; biological sex is female and her sexual
preference oscillates frequently.
 </td>
      <td> Portius is an smart and accomplished doctor with a rebelious streak. They are also skilled in the fine art of spirit-making, a hobby which they have fashioned into a profitable source of income. As a person of many talents,
they are also a capable barber and love doing people&#39;s hair. Multi-talented and driven to succeed in every facet of their life, they&#39;re also compelled to fight for social justice as well. They strongly disagree with the 
practices and teachings of the mercantile churches and have devoted their spare time to breaking their hold on their society. They have used some of their professional clout through the various guilds that they belong to,
to further this aim. They know that this has painted a target on their back as an enemy of the churches, and are weary of stranegrs because of it.

through the local marketplace and caught a glimpse of a local artist displaying his work. The artist was surrounded by paramours and admirers and sat leisurely in the sun. Goodness. That sure beats slaving in the heat. 
He thought to himself. After many nights of prayer for the life of a prosperous artist to what seemed silent gods, Salanar instead turned to roaming through the small temple district of his home town. There he questioned
the holy men and women why his prayers went unanswered. &quot;The God&#39;s won&#39;t respond to selfishness. Our pantheon honors the disiplined accrual of experience and provides fecund rewards for such&quot; one notable priest replied.
&quot;Well, who might grant me my wish?&quot; Salanar inquired. &quot;You. You can.&quot; the high priest responded resolutely. Bullshit, he thought, trudging back to perform his duties in the kitchen. If only I could have that life. I&#39;d give
anything. That night, after a long shift stewing meats and cleaning surfaces, Salanar had a vision in his sleep of a decayed ancient elf in regal robes and ancient chain, its face sunken with black opal eyes staring
straight into Salanar&#39;s bone marrow. Quiet your pleas for more, boy. I&#39;ll give you all you wish for... Petrified and unable to wake, Salanar sunk deeper into the dream. You only need to pledge your very being to me through
life and into death. The figure made a broad gesture to one side and Salanar&#39;s mind was filled with an infinite number of beautiul works of art pouring over one another again and again, and again and again, and his heart
filled with the hope to become the artist he always wanted. His very bones agreed to Kiaransalee&#39;s terms. When he awoke the next morning, Salanar was filled with such confidence and inspiration that he began demanding that
others call him &#39;Primo&#39;. He proceeded to fill the taverns, markets, and streets with his labor and produce volumes of art. Little did he expect, he became haunted by undeath. Ghosts, wraiths, and more, peer around corners,
over window sills, and over his bed while he sleeps.

equality and abundance. Her peoples believed in the beauty imparted by by Ku, her peoples concept of a central spiritual entity. The philosophy of Ku dictates that all things happen at the same time and that time is merely
the gift of enjoying every moment that has or will exist. Her beliefs fuel her beauty and her beauty fuels her beliefs

      <td> Ateh is sweet and bright and devoted to her people and their future. She can be slightly flaky in the way that artists can be. She knows that she is still being hunted and it worries her, but not as much as the plight of
her people worries her.

      <td> Raskolnik was born to a low-ranking court bureaucrat father, who was intelligent to the point of unfulfilled dreams, and a moderately wealthy mother, whose inheritance was spent before her children knew the words &quot;dice&quot;, 
&quot;wine&quot; or &quot;whores&quot;. Raskolnik&#39;s father was inadvertently trampled by a mail coach when Raskolnik was a young child. His mother, now without income and living in poverty in a grand manse among the snow elves, had little 
choice but to sell the remnants of her inheritance and take up residence in the squalid slums with the orcs and goblins of the north. Raskolnik&#39;s mother said, on more than one occasion, &quot;We elves are not known for helping
the downtrodden, even our own kind.&quot; Raskolnik excelled at his studies, and was noticed by an orcish ambassador to the north for winning second prize in the &quot;Essays from the Ghetto&quot; contest. His prose and unorthodox, even
mildly disturbing, thesis had captured the imagination of the fiery, blunt orc. The orcish ambassador gave Raskolnik&#39;s mother a small sum to pay for his studies in law, on the promise that she would send him to &quot;anything 
but a pale-skinned school of fascist pig-donkeys.&quot; Raskolnik&#39;s mother, partly from gratitude to her son&#39;s orcish benefactor, and partly from anger at her own culture&#39;s complete detachment from her financial predicament,
readily agreed. Raskolnik went to a law school run by halflings. (When the orcish diplomat found out, he flew into a rage. He had envisioned a green-skinned school for green-skinned law. But that is another story that shall
not be told here.) His studies were spectacularly successful. The halflings considered Raskolnik one of their own. But the humans were next to adopt him. During a multi-racial rhetoric competition in a prominent northern
city, Raskolnik won second place overall.  The human judge took him aside after the debate and told him that he had the potential to be a great leader, a great statesman. The human asked for a written essay that he could
take to his superiors in the middle lands, and in return, the human would pave the path to a fulfilling career in the human legal system. Raskolnik submitted his magnum opus to the human, sending a 20,000 word thesis on the
nature of The Great Man to his would-be human benefactor. The human published it under his own name and went on a book-signing tour, only to be murdered by an orc on his yacht in the south (though that tale of greed,
debauchery and violence is another story, and shall not be told here.) Raskolnik, blissfully unaware of his human would-be-benefactor&#39;s fate, continued to wait, hopefully, for word from the human. He had finished law school.
He sold what he owned and borrowed money from a disreputable lender. He tried valiantly to support his mother and younger sister. Raskolnik&#39;s sister agreed to marry a rich, abusive man. Raskolnik became desperate. Meanwhile,
word had -- unbeknownst to Raskolnik himself -- gotten out that he was the actual author of the human&#39;s stolen manuscript. Raskolnik was known only by name -- not by appearance -- to be an ubermensch, a believer in Great
Men who are justified in trampling the Inferior. Soon, Raskolnik will discover that the local constabulary have read his treatise, and suspect him of murdering the moneylender in order to pave the way to Greatness.
Raskolnik is riddled with guilt, not entirely for killing the woman (he partly believes she deserved it), but also for not being Great like he should be: for not being able to carry through with his own ambitions, for not
being able to Act in the way that Great Men Act.

masters. He was a natural fit for their training and military crusades. Over time, Reed&#39;s clan spread far and wide in their explorations and claims to various regions. His soul has become that of a wanderer. Make no
mistake, however, because Reed is not a Ronin. He stands devout in his devotion to his family and their military objectives, acting as a diplomat, messenger, and trader of their fine goods. Often receiving mass imports from
his home, he busies his days refining and sophisticating his market booth and managing his inventory to best provide an authentic experience of his culture.

guardian minotaur. The missionaries did not wish to slay the beast as they discovered it had been charmed to guard the relic. In the battle, the Minotaur was clubbed hard to the skull in an attempt to subdue them.

priestesses of the Order - a beautiful gnomish woman. &quot;You will heal in time,&quot; she said gently. The Minotaur was overwhelmed with her beauty and overwhelmed with her gentle touch. The charm spell coupled with
serious head trauma loosened the Minotaur from his memories and sense of identity. They internalized their caretaker and formed a new version of themself in their head - that of a helpful gnome. Once fully recovered, and

They did not expect a guardian minotaur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missionaries did not wish to slay the beast as they discovered it had been charmed to guard the relic. In the battle, the Minotaur was clubbed hard to the skull in an attempt to subdue them. The Minotaur lost  consciousness and the clerics uncovered the relic and returned it, along with the Minotaur, to their temple district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minotaur came to consciousness in the presence of one of the healing priestesses of the Order - a beautiful gnomish woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;You will heal in time,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; she said gently. The Minotaur was overwhelmed with her beauty and overwhelmed with her gentle touch. The charm spell coupled with serious head trauma loosened the Minotaur from his memories and sense of identity. They internalized their caretaker and formed a new version of themself in their head - that of a helpful gnome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once fully recovered, and properly guided to an identifiable name, Roly, by their caretaker, they made their way about town looking to help others. The local innkeeper sympathized with Roly and offered them the position of Porter for the Inn. Roly&#39;s incredible service gained notoriety and local merchants and guilds began to enlist their services.&lt;/p&gt;

      <td> When someone needs something dirty done, something that will inspire ire in the minds of the local guard or militia, one does not turn to a friend or even an acquaintance unless they wish trouble to descend upon their home
or business. Instead, one turns to a paid person, a person who they may only know through stories at the tavern or from the songs of a bard. Samuel Cohen comes up in both story and song. His dreams ring of each story and
lyric. A haunting or a gift? Not even Samuel can tell. Samuel is an orphan. He hasn&#39;t received word from the clergy as to who his parents were or the circumstances through which he was dropped off. One thing he does
know is that he doesn&#39;t really care. Family is for the blind. His youth in the orphanage in a small town was as expected: violent and traumatizing. He learned quickly the value of exchanging things or coins for safety or
services. What&#39;s more, and what he may not have even consciously learned, per se, was from the conditioning imposed upon him by the clergy of Khalal [A separatist sect turned sour], a deity of scarcity largely followed by
the marginalized and desperate. These priestesses and nuns would subject the children to questionable behavior modification experiments in their sleep. There goal was to remove the resentment and contempt from the desperate
and replace it with gratitude and hope. Little did they know, they had created entire worlds in the minds of their guinea pigs. Upon release from the clergy during his adolescence, Samual vowed to care about only one
thing: how he could advance himself in the waking world.

      <td> When the village of Everskinnis [Any Elven village] was raided by Ogres and goblinoids, the inevitable results of the plunder and pillage was that the ravaged female escapees would birth half-breeds. Relima Haas, a young
woman and former wife of a fine hunter who fell in the raids, was among these poor women. The gestation period was more than draining and the birth fatal. Scarback was born. Scavenging for food and other sustenance
and forced to reform their beliefs and direction, the camp of survivors raised Scarback in the wilderness. He learned to value the spirits of the wild beasts and flora. He also learned the value of connecting with the rage
he felt over the abuses imparted upon his mother and her now scattered community of hunters. A small portion of these survivors refused to live in survival-mode and instead departed together to seek a better life.
Scarback followed. The 5 departees were the smarter and more talented of the group. One of these departees was a beautiful young elven woman named Bodius towards whom Scarback took a serious liking. Traveling village to
village, they would perform feats of strength and agility for coins to wrangle up food or drink. In time, they came to be known as an entertaining side-show. On one fateful night, the group encountered a particularly
vicious pack of gnolls. Scarback fought valiantly while most of the group were slain. The gnolls plundered what they could and fled while Scarback was left tending to a seriously wounded Bodius with tears in his eyes.
&quot;Scarback love pretty elf-lady&quot;, he lamented. He tucked Bodius in the group&#39;s steamer chest and gently fed her, gave her water, and tended to her wounds as he made his way to the nearest township. Upon next opening the
steamer, Bodius was somewhat recovered and attempted to get out. &quot;No. Elf lady not safe&quot;, Scarback proclaimed as he knocked her out with a back hand. He tied her up securely, stuffed cloth in her mouth, and closed the
chest, determined to keep Bodius safe from harm. Yet, that same day, when he made his way through town his mind encountered a serious psychological schism; he couldn&#39;t accept what he&#39;d done and immediately began searching
for Bodius. At the same time he has an inexorable bond with his steamer trunk. Twice daily, in private, he will check on his belongings and only then recognize that Bodius remains in the chest. He will feed her and provide
her water, only to Bind and gag her and lock the steamer back up.

      <td> Scarback is a conflicted being. A behemoth with deminished mental capacity, his poor fracured mind cannot deal with the reality of his situation. He loves and cares so deeply for Bodius that he does not want any more harm
to come to her. But in his zeal to protector her, he has denied her comfort and freedom. At the same time, a combination of massive amounts of alcohol and the power of self-denial, he mostly dissociates his mind from the
torture that he has actually perpetrated upon her. The drunker her gets, the more he wanders and laments his &quot;lost&quot; love despite her being, however unwillingly, by his side the whole time

      <td> Sister Uriah Quartz grew up poor in the rougher parts of town. She learned the ways of the Rune Knight from her family, but once she went out on her own, things went south fast. Out of work and out of money she ended 
up turning to prostitution. One night while working in a brothel, a vampire paid the establishment a visit. While the beast was ravaging its way through the house, Uriah used her Rune Magic to surprise and slay the 
monster. That night she felt the blessing of the moon goddess for the first time and used her blessing to heal all of the other girls ravaged by the vampire and prevent them from turning. Feeling her new calling, 
she left her life of sin and joined a convent devoted to the goddess. She learned the ways of the Twilight Clerics and devoted her life to ridding the world of fiends and the undead. After 200+ years of fighting the 
forces of darkness, she has become one tough old bird and is not to be trifled with. In her tenure, she repeatedly crossed paths with The Phantom, eventually leaving the convent to join his Dead Hunters full time.

      <td> Sister Uriah Quartz is tall for a dwarf, coming in at just over 5 feet tall. She is also broad and heavily muscled. She is dark-skinned with long gray hair and and a gray, braided beard. She wears the tradition nun&#39;s 
habit of her order over top of full chainmail armor. She carries a huge warhammer strapped to her back, and carries a Holy silver shield with a large moon shaped sapphire in it center that acts as her holy symbol and 
spellcasting focus. She is gruff and wise and has been around the block more than a few times. She is compassionate and loving towards her companions, and acts as a judgement-free minister and confessor for the local 
bordellos and brothels, giving solace, advice and blessings to those in need. She is also a force to be reckoned with when it comes to battling fiends and the undead. She is also one of the very few people who know 
The Phantom&#39;s secret. She is not a fan of him being undead, but she knows his story, his patrons and his mission and accepts them as valid.

and both died of diabetes when Swarth was in his teens. By then he had acquired talents for curing and preparing meats, to a level that his parents had never quite achieved. While desserts were his father&#39;s specialties,
and potato dishes his mother&#39;s, Swarth prepared liver pastes and deep fried pseudodragons like no other. He worked his way up slowly, from cook to sous-chef to chef, often replacing his predecessor by virtue of fearsomeness
and a frighteningly sharp cleaver. He owns the tavern where he is now barkeep and head chef, having spent half a lifetime (and several subordinates) there.  Two pale spotty boys help out with the cooking and food
preparation during busy hours, and the waitress roles are filled from a revolving door of ladies of all ages, shapes and sizes. Swarth&#39;s food comprises layers of various types of meat, exquisitely arranged, often with a
liver paste &quot;S&quot; signature on top. During a recent bar mitzvah catered by Swarth, Flee -- whether deliberately or accidentally -- slapped Swarth in the face with a chain.  Ever since, Swarth has been trying to find Flee. 
He does not know what punishment lies in store for Flee, only that face is important to be saved.

in the mountain. Vys would task the clan with securing the cavern tunnels and with raiding nearby trading routes for treasures to pile atop his horde. One evening, Vys heard her singing and demanded she sit atop his horde
for the rest of her life to entertain him. Not a great deal in the mind of anybody, really, even a kobold, and Symmetry (again, not her birth name, but she won&#39;t tell) grew disenfranchised with her life with Vys and her
clan&#39;s unwillingness to stand up to the tyrant dragon. Vys would sleep often and would wake easily. He abhorred her silence and would punish her for it. She found a cunning solution. &quot;Vys, you want newer songs? You must be
getting bored of the ones I know&quot;, she whispered in his ear in draconic. &quot;Yes,&quot; the dragon&#39;s deep growl trembled the piles of gold and treasures, &quot;I am.&quot; The dragon chuckled sardonically. &quot;Well, I must read to learn new
songs. And to read I must be quiet.&quot; &quot;Ay. Then silence for an hour.&quot; The great red dragon purred. Symmetry (again, I insist not her birth name) took an hour each day to learn more songs, more spells, and more knowledge
from the tomes and treasures that littered Vys&#39; lair. When a commanding officer of the Kut-Kut tribe rushed in one day to alert Vys that a small party of heroes had breached the cave depths, chaos ensued. Little did Vys
know, this was a ruse created by a small group of rebels who sought to escape the caverns. In the ensuing chaos, Symmetry was able to distract Vys with songs and aid in their escape. The small kobold crew bonded over the
weeks of travel that followed and set their sites on using their abilities to gain their own wealth. Upon arriving in a nearby city, they set forth to &#39;relieve&#39; the population of their wealth. On a night of rest in a
removed alleyway, Symmetry&#39;s song of her groups&#39; exploits was overheard by a beggarly human who knew the value of being able to aid in disbanding this group of bandits and, perhaps even more so, the value of informing the
watch as to the location of Vys&#39; lair. He turned the information over for a handsome reward. The Regional Watch found the band of kobolds with haste. Symmetry was a primary target with her bright clothes and distinct
appearance. However, using the secrets found in Vys&#39; lair, Symmetry was able to terrify the Watchman and escape. The rest of her band scattered. Symmetry has been in flight ever since and makes a good living from selling
her secrets - via letter - to the Regional Watch; sending them on wild goose chases.

and her important role in the defense of the city. She is, after all, the primary provisioner for the militia. Raised in the farmlands surrounding the city that were provisioned by Baron Korimir Havensloch upon the 
inception of his oligarchical rule, Teaghan spent her early years as a farmhand on the farmlands of her immediate and extended family. When the threat of encroaching waves of Hobgoblins and Orcs threatened the security of
the city, the militia required more streamlined channels for sundries and provisions. The Baron chose the Forestlight family as the primary provisioner and Teaghan&#39;s family were locked into the role.

in her monastic training and grew ever more proficient in the art of fighting with her preferred weapon, the spear. Cryxistmalin would occasionally visit Thaerus secretly as a child and tell her stories of a long lost
village by the sea that was settled by the Genasi children of a handful of water Djinn who somehow found each other in the world. Thaerus believed this story to be entirely fiction through her childhood and adolescent
years, and would likely still believe so today if she hadn&#39;t witnessed her father&#39;s murder; a punishment for revealing this secret to her administered by another, more powerful Djinn. Cryxistmalin used his last dying breaths
to hide Thaerus from the eyes of Djinns who would wish to see this secret die along with him, imbuing her weapons with elemental magic, and providing her with a large sum of wealth. Today, Thaerus is obsessed with finding
this lost city, learning why it&#39;s existence is such a strongly protected secret and avenging her father. She has invested her inheritance from her father in the development of an archeological exploration company that she

offering hearth and home to those people among whom one lives. Cared for by multiple different members of this closeknit community, he gained a deep love for the &#39;commoner&#39; - he or she that partakes in those daily
activities that support a group and form its foundational infrastructure. He thusly also learned the various skillsets that complement such a vision: brewing, cooking, textile work. Creating fabulous rare brews of mountain
apples and deephops or lush woven fabrics for bed linens and window dressings; these were the lively activities that colored his youth. However, these beautiful products were being created during a time when neighboring
mountain Dwarven cities, such as Kindlebrough and Cynd [Dwarven cities], and various Human settlements in the Eastern Plains [Broad Settled Expanse] were suffering from hunger and poverty. This wondrous pallette of the best
aspects of Dwarven culture was suddenly disrupted after a pact was struck upon between these two communities - a pact for mutual expansion. A collective response was required from Thane&#39;s tribe and an aristocracy quickly
formed as the village leaders were overcome with panic and sudden greed. Quickly rising in power, this group condensed to a few self-appointed leaders. They became tyrants in a matter of months, enforcing impossible laws
that led to austere and deprived conditions. Families were broken and scattered. Vowing to one day return and bring his people back to their glory, Thane fled for weeks searching for a civilization within which to begin his
life anew and share the ethical codes of his people with the world at large. Thane&#39;s inborn work ethic gained traction with village markets and it wasn&#39;t long before he had accrued enough coin to begin planning to return to
his people. His connections to the people with whom he resettled excite him at the potential that he will not return to his home alone.

scarred. With no husband or career to support her or the orphanage they had just built together, Maria put her acting and makeup skills to work for her and created The Carnelian Shroud and began robbing wagons and carriages
on horseback. As she became more and more successful, she began to recruit groups of struggling young men and sending them out into the country side in gangs to continue raising funds so she had to venture out less and less
and could spend more time focusing on her orphanage. As the legend grew, so did the income. Now every cent that isn&#39;t being paid to her men in the field is anonymously donated to orphanages around the countryside.

flair for the dramatic, but she does her best to keep that under wraps now adays. She works hard to provide a decent life for the orphans she supports through her endavours and has been successful enough in her
&quot;alternative career&quot; to support many orphanages throughout the countryside </td>

      <td> Training in the monastery of the Reclusive Abbots of Iremore, Firmoore&#39;s father was distant and removed. This was most  likely because Firmoore&#39;s birth was a scar on the face of the monastery since sex and procreation,
especially out of wedlock, were forbidden. Thus, his existence was kept secret from the abbots and the small township of peoples that surrounded the monastery. Although emotionally unavailable, his father still trained him
in the ways of the Abbots. He learned quickly in order to impress his father and in hopes of gaining his attention. When the monastery was raided by the political faction in charge of the region and its hidden riches of
lore and ornate religious items plundered, Firmoore&#39;s father was among the dead. The township was broken and its population scattered. In flight, Firmoore and his mother landed in a nearby port-town known for its fine
imported ales. As his mother aged, she fell victim to a respiratory condition and Firmoore was faced with tending to her while generating a decent income. He took to tending bar at a popular tavern and acquired a taste for
the numerous imported ales that populated its stores. He vowed to gain revenge for his father&#39;s death and would train into early hours of the morning in the storehouse of the tavern, siphoning ales as he went. He developed
a drunken style that aided significantly in bouncing unruly patrons. When the owner of the tavern discovered that Firmoore had been removing him of &#39;surplus stock&#39;, he fired him. Returning to his mother that evening, drunk
and dismayed, he informed her of their new compromised financial position. &quot;You drunken coward,&quot; she condemned, &quot;you&#39;ve let your father down.&quot; Firmoore&#39;s mother passed away not long after. Left without roots, Firmoore 
traveled the region in search of another place to call home. Over his travels he earned significant sums fighting in pits and cages with the ardent fervor of unfulfilled revenge fueling his ferocity. Eventually finding
comfort in the town of Hiraas Calling, he used the purses he collected from his brief fighting career to open the Drunken Coward, a name he uses not only for his establishment but also for himself.

opportunity to take out his pent up aggression. </td>

      <td> The Monster is The Collegium Imaginata&#39;s dirty little secret. Roderick Holmestar was a brilliant chemist and alchemist and a founding member and board member of the Collegium, personally recruited by Oswald Vardklemp 
for his brilliant mind. He was kidnapped and tortured by a cult in an attempt to force him to create an immortality elixir for them. Failing to do so, they chose to sacrifice him to their patron gods.  Oswald and the 
Collegium attempted to track them down but arrived too late to save him. After dispatching the members of the cult, the Collegium collected Rodericks remains, took them back to their compound and rebuilt him. Using their 
collective knowledge of chemistry, biology, mechanics and artificer&#39;s magic, they managed to restore him to a semblance of life. Unfortunately, as much machine as he is undead man, his brilliant mind seems to be all 
but gone. He can&#39;t speak but has an animal ferocity and strength. The Collegium has tried to keep The Monster locked up, safe, but comfortable until they can figure out how to bring their friend back. But The Monster 
has escaped!

somewhat like Roderick did in life, but more of a grim parody and considerably larger. Unbeknownst to the other members of the Collegium, Roderick&#39;s mind is still mostly intact inside The Monster, but he can&#39;t seem to find 
his way back to the surface through the rage and confusion that is controlling the body. He does not remember who or what he was was before, but his intelect and knowledge is still there buried deep. It was Roderick&#39;s 
influence that encouraged The Monster to escape his comfortable prison in an effort to get out and find a way to bring himself back into control. </td>

the Con hails from, they only know that he is a Sylvan Elf because of his gaunt, lanky, and gruff appearance, ruddy skin and hair, and his bright silverish eyes. Nobody is sure what life trajectory brought the Pennymore Con
to where he is today. The few things that are known about him could be myth. The Con is blamed across the Realm for various high-level robberies and for starting various skirmishes between nations by offering a contract on
an important local Duke in exchange for a long-sought after item that had been fenced to him. Constantly seeking business with members of every eschelon of a city or town, the Con is open about his business dealings but
opaque as to his motivations. Consequently, although suspected of high crimes, none have been proven and the Con is allowed free movement. In fact, his movement is likely advocated among higher magistrates because of the
goods and services they&#39;ve obtained from him through less-than-legal means.

has a very contenious relationship with jovial head of the Dumas Family, Nicodeamus. Though he will do as he&#39;s told, he will do so with a grimmace and could possibly be persuaded to turn on Nicodeamus as long as it was in

      <td> Growing up as the son of a poor farmer can be hard as it is. Add alcoholism, abuse, and lecherous behaviors and you have the ingredients for an exploitative upbringing rife with imparted dysfunctional behaviors. Tristeth 
learned to put his focus on what he could control: whether or not small animals would live or die. As this trope would suggest, Tristeth began with the family cat. He then began picking off birds with his slingshot. He 
would carefully examine these animals inside and out, learning their morphologies and organic composition. He would often bury the parts separately in what he, arbitrartily, deemed to be the &quot;right spot&quot;. Nobody ever really
found out about his little hobby. He covered it up well by always having a variety of pets that he cared for. Eventually, Tristeth came of age where he had to choose between laboring on his father&#39;s farm or venturing out on
his own to pursue a different trade. The choice wasn&#39;t hard. He hated living there, as much as he adored a few of his 7 brothers and sisters. He departed to a nearby village and volunteered for the coroner of the religious 
order of Selune [Any Moon or Good Goddess] and learned various respectful means of preparing bodies for burial or pyre. Because this religious Order preached the sanctity of bodies and spirits, he also began changing his 
overall attitude and strange hobbies. Eventually he worked his way into the position of gravekeeper for the Order and currently presides over their countryside sacred burial grounds. He and his one bastard son, abandoned 
by his mother, reside in the small townhouse next to the burial grounds. Tristeth may be being exploited by Duergar Warlocks looking to sacrifice the bodies in the burial ground to an Evil Deity. Consequently, they 
have penetrated his mind and begun causing a sort of madness where Tristeth escapes to an astral realm that he calls, &quot;the Chalk&quot;. The Warlocks essentially send his astral form to wander an endless expanse of near 
nothingness; only faint and fading chalk outlines of reality. In the chalk, he is faced with the spirits of those the Warlocks seek to sacrifice next. The victim convinces Tristeth to continue his supply of bodies. He then 
wakes, exhausted and wondering why sleep no longer provides him rest. He&#39;s begun talking to himself and exhibiting odd twitches and spasms due to exhaustion.

At the age of 12 one of his experiments went awry and burned down his house, killing his entire family, yet he managed to escape without a scratch. In an effort to atone for his fatal mistake he began to use his skills 
against beings that he considered evil. Monsters, fiends, undead. As an extension of his alchemical pursuits, he stumbled his was into discovering and mastering firearms. During a failed attempt to take out a den of 
ghouls, Boomer was found, being overwhelmed, by The Phantom, who saved his life and invited him to join his fledgling organization. Finding a new focus for his guilt, he happily joined The Dead Hunters and devoted his 
life to the gods of good and building towards his redemption.

      <td> Uha &quot;Boomer&quot; Bannock is a large, scaly reptilian man with a protruding snout full of sharp teeth, yellow eyes, a long, thick prehensile tail with sharp scales and a serrated bone protrusion at the end.  He wears a tailored 
leather armored vest and pants full of pockets and pouches. He is as excitable and fiery as his weapon of choice. He&#39;s quick to anger, often to his detriment. He generally manages to keep his composure in the heat of 
battle against the Dead Hunter&#39;s quarries of choice, but dealing with regular people tends to brnig out the worst of him, and quickly. When it comes to his alchemical work and his explosives he is cool as a cucmber, 
attentive and diligent. Exceptionally detail oriented in his work, but there is still nothing he enjoys more than a good explosion.

      <td> Ulther Hapwath was originally a human but has spent most of their adult life experimaneting on and augmenting his own body in search of some distorted view of human perfection. A skilled spell slinger and hunter, 
they hunt and capture many specimens of various creatures to study and experiment on. They are a brilliant biologist with an exceptional knowledge of many different creatures anatomy and the steady hands of a 
surgeon. Recruited by Gerhardt Klippstein to join the Collegium for their vast biological knowledge, their employers are slightly less than keen on the reckless abandon with which they are willing to experiment 
on themselves. Since they joined the Collegium, they have been contacted by a mysterious benefactor from beyond the veil. Ulther has no idea who this benefactor is, but they have been helping to guild their 
self-evolution and in the creation of a substance called Cytoplast, a sort of ooze that helps with the bonding of upgrades and grants temporary healing when applied to a living creature.  Ulther&#39;s benefactor is 
in fact, the disembodied spirit Momir Vig, disgraced and deceased former Guildmaster of the Simic Combine on the Plane of Ravnica. Somehow Momir has crossed into this world and is slowly using Ulther to create 
Cytoplast and use it to build him a new body.
 </td>
      <td> Ulther Hapwath is tall and muscular and severe-looking with pale blue skin and long. hip length, silver/white hair. They wears dark glasses as their replaced eyes are somewhat sensative to bright lights, and a 
long, black leather trenchcoat that cover most of their bodily features. On closer inspection, its clear that Ulther has made significant modification to their body. Barbed skin on their hands and feet like a 
spider for climbing, the wings of a manta for gliding, sections of crab-like shell armoring portions of their body and a segmented scorpions tail with stinger are all faintly noticeable if someone spends enough 
time looking at them, although they are often using some kind of glamour (disguise self, polymorph, etc.) when in public so as not to stand out as much. Ulther is fanatical about his work and about chasing his 
personal concept of bodily perfection and finds it hard to comprehend why everyone isn&#39;t seeking to augment thier bodies. They are reckless and never think twice about experimenting on themselves and have little 
regard for the wellbeing of the other creatures that they experiment on. Thanks to the influence of their secret benefactor, they have gradually started to explore the commonly unknown arcane study of biomancy. 
While mostly keeping this information to themselves, they have shared some of their studies with their close friend and fellow body-modifying scientist and Collegium member Thadeus Periwinkle. </td>

day, he despises those born with a silver spoon in their mouths and the culture that they enjoy. Supremely confident, he believes that what he lacks in book learning, he more than makes up for in raw intellect and street-
smarts. Furthermore, he knows that if he can’t win an argument with words, he can settle one with his fists, or his club “Widowmaker” just as easily. As a natural leader, people have always naturally been drawn to him. It 
is this natural charisma combined with utter ruthlessness that allowed Varun to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld until he was ready to start his own thieves guild, the Bakerfield Family. From there, he 
waged a war on the other guilds, winning turf wars with violence and cunning until he and his guild were the only street level gang standing. During his rise, to help assure victory, Varun made a deal with a Lich named 
Ryxiltan. In exchange for a large portion of his guild’s earnings, Ryxiltan used his magic to permanently increase Varun’s strength and leadership presence going as far as giving him the ability to bend weak-minded 
criminals to his will whenever he pleased. Being the servant of a powerful Lich is no easy task. Despite his success, Varun regrets the deal he made and is looking for ways to get himself out of it.

      <td> Varun is a stern and agressive figure. He is supremely confident and pretty charasmatic, if he does say so himself. Growing up poor, he has a hefty contempt for all of the accoutrements that come along with nobility and old
money. His distate for authority extends to one of few decisions that he&#39;s ever regretted in his life, his deal with the Lich-Lord supporting his rise to power. </td>

      <td> Wendy Gol was born to farmers in the village of Eldwynn [A small Human settlement] in the plains of Overmarsh Gale [Any broad plain of rich, fertile soil]. Having a humble and challenging upbringing as the youngest of 3 
brothers and 4 sisters, Wendy sought the recognition of both parents, even when she married a well-respected farmer&#39;s son from an adjacent farm. Her longing for love and attention was never fulfilled and, as might be 
expected, Wendy was treated much like an employee of the farm and as a child by her husband. This lack of recognition and attention was so profound that Wendy would often wander towards the sparse woods nearby which she 
heard from her siblings contained caves and steppes that were home to covens of witches who were known to wield great magicks. Her mundane life drove her to the excitement of trying to uncover where this coven was hiding.
Upon her 21st birthday, recieving no celebrations, Wendy made her usual trip to the woods nearby. Upon entering the shade of the canopies she heard a whisper in the back of her mind. &quot;We are here. We have been watching. 
You are welcome, sister.&quot; Shocked and elated, Wendy drove deeper into the woods until she came upon a chipped and cracked carving out of the steppe wall surrounded by entageled roots and vines. A beautiful elven face slowly
advanced from the darkness of the cave and into the light. Smiling, the Elven woman said, &quot;Welcome, sister. We have been waiting&quot; and she gently beckoned Wendy to enter the cave. Wendy cautiously entered the cave which was 
populated by 4 beautiful elven women dressed in wondrous garments standing around a fire. The four held hands to form a circle, yet leaving one spot open. &quot;Come girl&quot;, one said, &quot;find your true place in this world&quot;. Wendy 
joined the circle and was suddenly filled with a surge of disgust, hatred, and bilious discontent. &quot;We pledge to thee, dear Wendy, that you will never be ignored again!&quot; At this moment, Wendy&#39;s husband, who had been 
following her into the woods for sometime to investigate what his wife was up to, burst into the cave. &quot;You vile creatures, leave her be!&quot; He shouted. Cackling, the coven charmed the young man and demanded that Wendy 
consume him with them if she were to truly become something more than a farmer&#39;s daughter. Having been charmed herself, Wendy followed their demands. Cackling as Wendy&#39;s once beautful appearance withered into that of an 
old, wicked hag, the coven surged in a circle of blue and green electrical ethereal energy that concluded with a blast of light centered upon Wendy who promptly squatted and laid an egg. The coven cackled in concert yet 
again as the egg hatched and a chick stumbled forth with a head that was an exact replica of her husband. One member of the coven snatched the fleeing chick and forced it down Wendy&#39;s throat, crying in a crackled voice, 
&quot;henceforth you will be Wendigola, she who lost her beauty to her longing...&quot; Reluctantly reborn and recognizing she hadn&#39;t gained the power and comradery she had expected, Wendigola fled the cave as the coven&#39;s cackling 
slowly faded away among the interstices of the steppes and trees.

brilliant business man in the importing and exporting industry, it only took Weston III, a whole 3 years to run his family business into the ground. Couple that with his large gambling addiction and terrible gambling skill,
alcohol addiction and illicit substance addiction, and it adds up to Weston III being flat broke and bordering on homeless. He still does his utmost to keep up appearances and flits among high society parties and taverns

great show of bravado, acting like his life hasn&#39;t gone to pot, but inside he knows that he&#39;s a failure. So he&#39;ll continue to grift through life until something changes or everybody catches on to what a fraud he is. </td>

taxes and scutage. Wureok has organized a growing rebel faction among the peasants and townsfolk, using the pressures he himself applies to turn them against his benefactor, then twisting the stories of uprisings in

He slapped his hands together and rubbed them vigorously, laughing to himself. &quot;What does this day have to offer?&quot; He stepped forward out of the cave and his foot found no ground. The black swamps of Kol-oug had deceived 
yet another. Whoever Yasloh used to be was absorbed into the gritty sandy mire of Kol-oug. How could I have forgotten the bloody swamp? Was the last thought that crossed his mind before the Mind Flayer pit swamp consumed 
his identity. Three days later a small humanoid limped his way towards a makeshift Halfling military camp. &quot;Who goes there?&quot;, cried the lieutenant. The &quot;Brain&quot; began to reflect upon itself and found nothing. Well, who does 
go here? He asked himself. Nothing. &quot;Who goes there?&quot; The lieutenant asked again. Oh, well, I had better answer him. He seems important. &quot;Brain!&quot; Yasloh shouted the only thing he could think. &quot;Brain&quot; approached the militia 
party having all the smarts he had before but having no idea who he actually was. &quot;Oy, innit a gnome...&quot;, the halfling lieutenant remarked, &quot;covered in muck&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot;, Yasloh replied, &quot;a swamp gnome&quot;. &quot;But there&#39;s no such...&quot;
Yasloh shot the soldier an intimidating glance. Silence. They gave &quot;Brain&quot; a place to clean up and change.  During this reflection time his mind filled with criss-crossing images of shimmering grids and incoherent numbers 
and languages. These hallucinations eventually began to congeal into gears, sigils, machinations, glyphs, and locations of great power. It appeared as though Yasloh had fallen asleep in the bath at the camp and he began 
muttering incomprehensibly in an increasing volume until he was nearly shouting. A young Halfling soldier approached to shake him awake. &quot;Sir. Sir? Are you okay? Are you...&quot; And Yasloh shot up in the bathtub screaming 
valorously, &quot;I&#39;ve got it mate!&quot; He may have lost his past but now saw the many magical inventions that would define his future.

far as he&#39;s concerned, thats all that matters anyway. He is manic, intense and animated all the time, to a level that doesn&#39;t seem possible to maintain for any length, yet there he goes. He talks constantly to anyone who 
will listen, and even those who won&#39;t, giving advice, sharing his thoughts and finding, no matter how little they make sense. </td>

      <td> The hillside Dusk Goblins of Akhlo-Meek [Any major Goblin Village] remain relatively peaceful and rarely disrupt humanoid settlements beyond the hills. They are however plagued by raids from Underdark Goblins that emerge 
from the surrounding caves. These raids pose a serious threat, particularly because they result in captives being taken and enslaved. The Mountain Goblins are tactical in so far as they specifically target youth with the 
intention of converting them to following the increasingly violent and hate-fueled Goblinoid Deity Kyhaergebaerg [Any aggressive Goblinoid God]. Yeet was raised in this environment, inculcated with hatred for humanoid 
races and a desire to spill their blood, ravage their townships, and steal their shiny things. Yeet might have been captured at the right time for conversion and subjected to viscious and violent &#39;therapies&#39;, but he 
is still able to remember that he is a Dusk goblin. He&#39;s able to reflect on an upbringing that promoted brotherhood and stability. Nonetheless, he has still been infused with the hatred and bloodlust that characterizes 
Underdark Goblins. He is characterized by this dissonance. Drawn into a raid of purportedly magical Dwarven caves by a tyrannical hobgoblin, Herkog, Yeet played a lieutenant role in controlling the captured Dwarves and 
staving off any intruders. Yet the mission went amiss when a group of adventurers from the nearby frontier town of Rheidolen [Any small frontier town] were comissioned to clear the caves and interrogate Herkog about his 
connections to the violent raids on surrounding towns. Herkog was slain and the goblin population eliminated. Except for Yeet. Because Herkog was slain before he could be questioned, this party of adventurers questioned 
Yeet instead. Yeet broke down and told them of how he is a Dusk Goblin and should never have been involved in this affair. He begged or his life and gave the adventuring party more than enough information to continue on 
with achieving their objectives. He was escorted back to Rheidolen for questioning and a potential trial but, because of the lack of security and organization in this frontier town, it was easy for such a crafty Goblin to 
escape. He now roams the wilderness and distant towns seeking other dusk Goblins.

Tieflings praised Kenaan [or another Tiefling God of Destruction], whose nihilistic followers only became more fervent in their belief that the destruction of the Realm is the only cure for the madness infecting the other 
races and peoples. Ysyfar was born and raised in this culture and inculcated with their deep religious beliefs and rituals that centered on eradicating not just the peoples of the realm, but the realm itself. He gained 
popularity among his people for his religious services that provided vicious and scathing diatribes condemning the other races. As the war spilled over into surrounding villages, Ysyfar proudly organized forces to defend 
his people. This religious paramilitary group gradually grew into an offensive force and Ysyfar was granted leadership as Martial of Kenaan. With an entourage of soldiers of his order, this devoutly faithful warrior travels
the region visiting temples of various deities to evaluate their role in the wars that characterize the races. He is very calculated in these &#39;visits&#39;, aware that he and his Order, while not well known, are not accepted 
nor desired among the other communities of the region. Often found in deep prayer at the entrance to a temple or to a statuette of a deity acceptable to Kenaan, Ysyfar will rarely compromise his maleficent pilgrimage and

      <td> Long escaped from the control of Mind Flayers, Zirrash&#39;ka and his tribe also fled the plane of Limbo [Any non-material plane] and integrated themselves among villages of elves on the rim of known civilization. Quietly 
keeping to themselves and continuting their gratitude towards their patrons, his tribe thirsted for knowledge of the material plane. They formed a monastic tradition that offered worship and tithing to Jegel, the God of 
Scribes and Depositioner of the Passed (Or any Deity overlooking the passing of the living to the Dead). They pledged to keep track of all those denizens that once lived, how they lived, and when, how, where, and why they 
died. Over the decades they developed an advanced library and monastary, training their monks in the value of knowledge, gratitude, courage, and direct action.
