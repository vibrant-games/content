    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;The Drow are a largely rejected race in the Realms. Numeorus tribes have departed from traditional ways in hopes of achieving peace for themselves and between themselves and the denizens of the Upper World. The clans of Dire Dawa [Any Underdark Village] of North Woreda [Any Underdark Region] seek such noble ends. A self-appointed council of diplomats in this village have made it their goal to spread the word that the people of the Underdark are best set to survive and flourish with the cooperation of the other races of the Realms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since most magic is under strict control within most of the Underdark and thus messages and missives are difficult to convey, the peoples of Dire Dawa needed to rely on actual footwork to pass messages between and across the peoples of the Underdark who sought to escape the control of the few dark deities who had gained the majority of control in the regions. They relied on &#39;runners&#39; to bring messages back and forth. Abrinet was chosen as one of the few to play this revered position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not the fittest or most able, it was her commitment to absolving the Underdark of its ills that convinced her town council to appoint her as a &#39;runner&#39;. She has yet to let them down, except for her more than occasional travels to the Upperworld.&lt;/p&gt;
