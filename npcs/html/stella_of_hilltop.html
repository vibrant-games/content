    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt; Hilltop [Village; Town] is a quiet halfling town located on a well-used trade route. This has conditioned the population to become diverse in their skillsets and relatively wealthy overall - compared to other halfling settlements. With all the coming and going of people and voluminous exchange of coins, goods, and services, people can get lost. When people get lost and nobody comes looking for you, well, then what do you do? A lecherous and ornery halfling grain and feed merchant from the nearby economic centre of Invasaad [Major City] was traveling through Hilltop with his &quot;best employees&quot;, his three young daughters. The girls would heave the sacks of grain and feed on and off the cart or sometimes would be responsible for interacting with immediate buyers. In one transaction, the feed had been hauled onto the buyer&#39;s cart whilst Stella - the youngest of the 3 sisters - was bargaining for the first time with a crotchety old woman who couldn&#39;t afford to feed her goats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll give ya two silver, nothin more! My husband has passed and we &#39;ad no children. I&#39;m left to me own devices! &#39;Ave pity on an old lady&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering how her father would deal abusively with her sisters whenever they returned with less than he expected, Stella continued to bargain. In the meanwhile, her father, who had grown tired of feeding a third child and who had resigned himself to cutting down the weakest buffalo, had carried on in the cart out of town. Stella continued to barter, none the wiser, until the argumentative customer wouldn&#39;t budge. She looked back for her father&#39;s approval and saw no cart, no father, no sisters. Stella ended the barter, panicked. She raced around town thinking that her father had other dealings. He was nowhere to be found. Young Stella wept in the square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually that evening a kind elderly halfling woman approached the weeping figure. She comforted her. Told her their were bigger problems. Bigger problems that needed solutions. The kind elderly halfling lady told Stella, &quot;you&#39;re from where you choose to be from. You can be Stella of Hilltop&quot;. The name stuck and Stella quickly became a surrogate child to the people of Hilltop. Her father never did return.&lt;/p&gt;
