      &lt;p&gt;The high elves of the Northern Expanse have remained stoic in their pursuit of peace with the surrounding Nations. This is exemplified in their various treatises. Hailing from this environment sounds near idyllic and its peoples destined for greatness in politics. Well, perhaps only half of this is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over her 150 years, for sure, Libil has achieved political prominence in the regional Merchants&#39;s Guild. She has been an important figure in the negotiations between the various increasingly expanding trading companies that threatened to put a stranglehold on individual merchants. Libil established, nearly single-handedly, the regulations for these companies and the available guilds for the individual merchants on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libil&#39;s upbringing among the purportedly peaceful High Elves should bespeak the formation of a law-abiding character. Her knowledge of their inner-workings led her astray from this destiny. Instead, Libil learned that the High Elves, out of survival or desperation, had been conducting various unethical surgical strikes against surrounding Nations; unethical because they betrayed the expectations of the treatises and were kept out of the public eye. This led Libil to pursue the art of inquisition, of unearthing the truth of a situation, and drove her in a long-standing bid as High Journeyman of the Regional Thieves&#39; Guild. Instead of abiding by laws that seemed to only mask the horrible truths that underpin the appearance of peace, She seeks to achieve true peace and stability for &#39;boots on the ground&#39; through the unionization structures that guilds bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She can often be found in the busiest marketplaces of large towns and cities, directing traffic, solving squabbles, and enlisting merchants to join the guild (both Merchants&#39; and Thieves&#39; (the latter often referenced, instead, as &#39;Workers&#39; Guild&#39;, or &#39;Commoners&#39; Association&#39;, or something of that ilk)).&lt;/p&gt;
