								&lt;p&gt;Spartan in nature (but without the honorable intent) Orcish culture is well-known for its celebration of brute strength and denunciation of the more feminine side of an individual&#39;s nature.

And we needn&#39;t fall victim to the same virulent hatred that afflicts the Orcs.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amin brought Ukhtor with him for the journey.
