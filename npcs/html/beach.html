    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Spartan in nature (but without the honorable intent) Orcish culture is well-known for its celebration of brute strength and denunciation of the more feminine side of an individual&#39;s nature. From birth, Beach, born &#39;Ukhtor&#39;, was smaller than his cohort and more inclined towards cleanliness and grace. As a baby he would cry and whine if exposed to violence or filth of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullied and beaten often for what were perceived as less &#39;Orcish&#39; features, even as an infant, Ukhtor&#39;s mother feared for her son growing up in such a horrible environment. What&#39;s more, she was embarrassed to have produced such a creature. During one of the war-party&#39;s treks between camps, she abandoned Ukhtor in a basket by a well-traveled road just outside of the party&#39;s planned travel path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local constables were escorting magistrates between nearby towns and cam across the basket. Peering inside, the head of the constabulary, Amin Carr, exclaimed, &lt;i&gt;&quot;cursed Orcs! They cannot even care for their own!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; &quot;Do away with the filthy runt!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; One of the constables sneered. &lt;/p&gt;Amin peered into Ukhtor&#39;s deep blues eyes and saw a nimble, dedicated soul; much different from the ferocious hatred he&#39;d seen in his battles against raid-parties. &lt;i&gt;&quot;No,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Amin exclaimed, &lt;i&gt;&quot;this one is different. And we needn&#39;t fall victim to the same virulent hatred that afflicts the Orcs.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amin brought Ukhtor with him for the journey. Staring into his sea-blue eyes he pronounced that the youngster be named &#39;Beach&#39;. Raised within the Constabulary&#39;s ranks, Beach learned skills more akin to his natural abilities and became an agile killer. He was also imbued with their sense of noblility and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
