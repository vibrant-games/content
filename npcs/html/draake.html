    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;The 2nd born son of a local baron, Draake could never stay still. As a young boy, he was formally trained as a knight. He and his brother Trassel were inseperable, but Draake knew he would never rule and he hated the pomp of court life. At 16 he left the castle in the night looking for adventure. He found it in a tavern where he met Taron. The two teenagers quickly became friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leaving his hometown of Oxlight behind him, the two adventured far and wide, both starting and ending many fights along the way. During this time, the charismatic Draake convinced more adventurers to join their ranks. At 24, Draake was captured on a raid and brought back to town. His brother, now Lord, almost didn&#39;t recognize him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Granted clemency, the two agreed to enrich each other. Trassel ensured that Draake would become the local bandit leader by sending his soldiers against all other gangs and in return Trassel recieved a cut from every raid. Draake would keep the gang in line and would take new recruits (criminals from Oxlight) which helped lower expenses for Trassel and made him look better to the king. This arrangement has persisted for the last 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
