    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Aspiring to be the Fountainhead of Clax, the High Duergar God of Pestilence and Destruction, Mammoon will stop at nothing to incarnate herself as the ultimate High Priestess; clad in the bones of a thousand dead, each bone tied to the next with the flesh of a thousand more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammoon&#39;s aspirations come from her abuse at the hands of a former spouse. Married young and corralled into the traditional power positions of a Duergar wife, Mammoon sought power over everything else and would be ruthless in this pursuit. She sought the faith of her village, the surrounding region, and eventually the Underdark. Vying for a position as Loxxed Priestess, comparable to a magistrate, Mammoon watched as her competitor gained greater and greater favor. This favor grew as her competitor finally had a child. This Duergard tribe had a particularly hard time reproducing and this was a sign from their God. Not only did she face ongoing abuse from her husband about her barren womb, Mammoon now faced imminent defeat in her pursuit of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the almost Spartan culture would allow, Mammoon snatched the child from its bed and brought it to the center idol of Clax, ringing the town bell. Many of her tribe flooded the streets to watch Mamoon sacrifice the child in offering to Clax. The statue reached down, scooped up the body, and consumed it violently. Mammoon was then imbued with an overwhelming sense that she was destined for greater things. She denounced the tribe in an animal growl and fled the Underdark in search of greater sacrifices to Clax. Seeing such violence in sacrifice has become her primary goal.&lt;/p&gt;
