    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;In the battle of Granite Water [any great historical battle in recent time], an old orcish warlock, Gryt Tooth of Mahl, was faced with certain death at the hands of an incoming legion of the Elves of ThistleCloud [Any Major Elven City]. He turned to his last resort: an old summoning scroll that was tattered. In desperation facing the encroaching legion, the warlock uttered as many words as he could read from the scroll and performed whatever gestures he could make out to cast the spell. Flashes of light and shadow burst from nowhere, colliding in mid air in a cloud of grainy black mist that congealed into the form of a beholder. However, the scroll had been damaged badly and the verbal and somatic components thus distorted. The unfortunate result was an undeveloped creature, Khedoldosh, who glanced around with its only working eye, realized the imminent danger, and darted off into the hills. Needless to say, Gryt Tooth didn&#39;t live much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
