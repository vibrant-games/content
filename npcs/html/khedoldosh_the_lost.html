			<h3>Roleplaying</h3>
			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<span><p>Khedoldosh maintains a tent/hut at the outskirts of a market or tavern district with a sign above the entrance that glows with faint magical energy and reads, &quot;TELLINGS&quot;. It can also be found slowly and carefully wandering from alleyway entrance to alley entrance. It may approach a group to ask for their help to obtain glyphs or sigils of farsight and offer to divulge important information in return.</p></span>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
		<span>	<p>A tiny, beholder - the runt of the litter that were summoned that day, you could say - that never developed properly; drapes a cloak over itself and uses well-crafted fake arms and its innate magical capacity to operate them as though real; Perception check (DC 22) allows a person to notice this is not a humanoid; She leans her body to one side, her right, showing her one gleaming working eye while she has a prosthetic that remains closed to represent her left eye; her remaining eyes are all underdeveloped or dead and stay limp, tied into a ponytail along with her prosthetic hair</p></span>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Expressions</h4>
			<span><p> &quot;You&#39;ve always got time to see the future, lad/lass. Take a minute to hear what Khedoldosh can offer&quot;; &quot;What can you see? I promise it cannot compare to my eye&quot;; &quot;How often are you offered a glimpse of your fate?&quot;; &quot;Only those who choose blindness over clarity of vision are truly lost...&quot;</p></span>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Mannerisms</h4>
			<span><p>Quietly dramatic poses - pointing, fist in hand, wide-open glaring eye - etc.; walks (floats) very deliberately as not to draw notice to its true form;</p></span>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Motivations</h4>
			<span><p>It desires knowing more. About anything. Yet is trapped in the paradox of already believing it knows more than others. Hoping for a revelation to free it from this cognitive prison, Khedolosh remains eternally frustrated. It is driven to uncover the unknown yet knows that revealing the unknown destroys mystery.

<h3>Background</h3>
		<span>	<p><p>In the battle of Granite Water [any great historical battle in recent time], an old orcish warlock, Gryt Tooth of Mahl, was faced with certain death at the hands of an incoming legion of the Elves of ThistleCloud [Any Major Elven City]. He turned to his last resort: an old summoning scroll that was tattered. In desperation facing the encroaching legion, the warlock uttered as many words as he could read from the scroll and performed whatever gestures he could make out to cast the spell. Flashes of light and shadow burst from nowhere, colliding in mid air in a cloud of grainy black mist that congealed into the form of a beholder. However, the scroll had been damaged badly and the verbal and somatic components thus distorted. The unfortunate result was an undeveloped creature, Khedoldosh, who glanced around with its only working eye, realized the imminent danger, and darted off into the hills. Needless to say, Gryt Tooth didn't live much longer.</p>
