											<h3>Introduction</h3>
							
										
										Khedoldosh maintains a tent/hut at the outskirts of a market or tavern district with a sign above the entrance that glows with faint magical energy and reads, &quot;TELLINGS&quot;. It can also be found slowly and carefully wandering from alleyway entrance to alley entrance. It may approach a group to ask for their help to obtain glyphs or sigils of farsight and offer to divulge important information in return.<br />
		
						
										</span>
		
		
										<span class="property-line">
			
											<h3>Appearance</h3>
										A tiny, beholder - the runt of the litter that were summoned that day, you could say - that never developed properly; drapes a cloak over itself and uses well-crafted fake arms and its innate magical capacity to operate them as though real; Perception check (DC 22) allows a person to notice this is not a humanoid; She leans her body to one side, her right, showing her one gleaming working eye while she has a prosthetic that remains closed to represent her left eye; her remaining eyes are all underdeveloped or dead and stay limp, tied into a ponytail along with her prosthetic hair
		
										</span>
		
		
										<span class="property-line">
			
											<h3>Expressions</h3>
											
											 &quot;You&#39;ve always got time to see the future, lad/lass. Take a minute to hear what Khedoldosh can offer&quot;; &quot;What can you see? I promise it cannot compare to my eye&quot;; &quot;How often are you offered a glimpse of your fate?&quot;; &quot;Only those who choose blindness over clarity of vision are truly lost...&quot;
		
										</span> 
		
		
										<span class="property-line">
			
											<h3>Mannerisms</h3>
											
											Quietly dramatic poses - pointing, fist in hand, wide-open glaring eye - etc.; walks (floats) very deliberately as not to draw notice to its true form;
		
										</span> 
		
		
										<span class="property-line">
			
											<h3>Motivations</h3>
										
											It desires knowing more. About anything. Yet is trapped in the paradox of already believing it knows more than others. Hoping for a revelation to free it from this cognitive prison, Khedolosh remains eternally frustrated. It is driven to uncover the unknown yet knows that revealing the unknown destroys mystery.
