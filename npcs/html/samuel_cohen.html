    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;When someone needs something dirty done, something that will inspire ire in the minds of the local guard or militia, one does not turn to a friend or even an acquaintance unless they wish trouble to descend upon their home or business. Instead, one turns to a paid person, a person who they may only know through stories at the tavern or from the songs of a bard. Samuel Cohen comes up in both story and song. His dreams ring of each story and lyric. A haunting or a gift? Not even Samuel can tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuel is an orphan. He hasn&#39;t received word from the clergy as to who his parents were or the circumstances through which he was dropped off. One thing he does know is that he doesn&#39;t really care. Family is for the blind. His youth in the orphanage in a small town was as expected: violent and traumatizing. He learned quickly the value of exchanging things or coins for safety or services. What&#39;s more, and what he may not have even consciously learned, per se, was from the conditioning imposed upon him by the clergy of Khalal [A separatist sect turned sour], a deity of scarcity largely followed by the marginalized and desperate. These priestesses and nuns would subject the children to questionable behavior modification experiments in their sleep. There goal was to remove the resentment and contempt from the desperate and replace it with gratitude and hope. Little did they know, they had created entire worlds in the minds of their guinea pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon release from the clergy during his adolescence, Samual vowed to care about only one thing: how he could advance himself in the waking world.&lt;/p&gt;
