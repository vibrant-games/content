      A well-traveled adventurer, guide and line-slinger, Nahkirin knows the canyons and mountains of Zendikar like the back of her hand. Like most Zendikari who lived through the Eldrazi war, she has been to hell and back and has the scars to prove it. Having lost so much and so many, she is reluctant let anyone new into her life. Between her adventuring and the war, she has found many passes through places that few have ever found their way through and marked the trails in her clan colors. She is an expert guide and always happy to get out of Seagate into the wilderness, even if it means guiding strangers to their destination. Before the war, she was a follower of the goddess Kamsa and a member of her order, but the likeness of her goddess now bares to much of a resemblance to the Eldrazi Titans for her to have any faith left. She has abandoned her order but still maintains the skills she has learned and has translated them into her daily life as a guide and adventurer
