    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Kobolds are kobolds. Well, not always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symmetry (not her birth name) was raised in a cavern den of the hundreds of kobolds making up the clan of Kut-Kut.  They were dedicated to serving the Red Dragon, Vys, who lived deeper in the mountain. Vys would task the clan with securing the cavern tunnels and with raiding nearby trading routes for treasures to pile atop his horde. One evening, Vys heard her singing and demanded she sit atop his horde for the rest of her life to entertain him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a great deal in the mind of anybody, really, even a kobold, and Symmetry (again, not her birth name, but she won&#39;t tell) grew disenfranchised with her life with Vys and her clan&#39;s unwillingness to stand up to the tyrant dragon. Vys would sleep often and would wake easily. He abhorred her silence and would punish her for it. She found a cunning solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Vys, you want newer songs? You must be getting bored of the ones I know&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, she whispered in his ear in draconic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; the dragon&#39;s deep growl trembled the piles of gold and treasures, &lt;i&gt;&quot;I am.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; The dragon chuckled sardonically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Well, I must read to learn new songs. And to read I must be quiet.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Ay. Then silence for an hour.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;The great red dragon purred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symmetry (again, I insist &lt;i&gt;not her birth name&lt;/i&gt;) took an hour each day to learn more songs, more spells, and more knowledge from the tomes and treasures that littered Vys&#39; lair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a commanding officer of the Kut-Kut tribe rushed in one day to alert Vys that a small party of heroes had breached the cave depths, chaos ensued. Little did Vys know, this was a ruse created by a small group of rebels who sought to escape the caverns. In the ensuing chaos, Symmetry was able to distract Vys with songs and aid in their escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small kobold crew bonded over the weeks of travel that followed and set their sites on using their abilities to gain their own wealth. Upon arriving in a nearby city, they set forth to &#39;relieve&#39; the population of their wealth. On a night of rest in a removed alleyway, Symmetry&#39;s song of her groups&#39; exploits was overheard by a beggarly human who knew the value of being able to aid in disbanding this group of bandits and, perhaps even more so, the value of informing the watch as to the location of Vys&#39; lair. He turned the information over for a handsome reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Regional Watch found the band of kobolds with haste. Symmetry was a primary target with her bright clothes and distinct appearance. However, using the secrets found in Vys&#39; lair, Symmetry was able to terrify the Watchman and escape. The rest of her band scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symmetry has been in flight ever since and makes a good living from selling her secrets - via letter - to the Regional Watch; sending them on wild goose chases.&lt;/p&gt;
