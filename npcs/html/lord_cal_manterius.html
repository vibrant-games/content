								&lt;p&gt;Wandering through the woods, Cal Manterius realized that he had no idea where he was or where he was going. The brain fog imposed by that Green Hag who was haunting his village lingered. &lt;i&gt;Was there a hag? What village?&lt;/i&gt; Cal&#39;s mind tumbled through what he thought were memories but wouldn&#39;t stop tumbling. He was getting dizzy. &lt;i&gt;Stop tumbling!&lt;/i&gt; He cried out in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stumbled into a clearing in the woods where ruined buildings from a long razed village jutted out of the landscape like giant skeletal fingers reaching for the freedom of the sky. &lt;i&gt;Is this where I was headed?&lt;/i&gt; Cal looked about. Seemed like a place that one might look for. He set up a makeshift camp, chewed down some jerky and tack, and grabbed himself a nice sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon waking, Cal&#39;s mind filled with wonder and glee that he had found what he had been searching for. &lt;i&gt;This is it! But why was I searching for this place?&lt;/i&gt; Cal searched the area further only to find burnt Firbolg bones and burnt equipment. &lt;i&gt;They did it again! They silenced us. We mustn&#39;t allow this!&lt;/i&gt; He thought to himself. His mind turned inward upon itself. All his memories of living and growing up in a regal Firbolg village became muddled together with his recent explorations. He couldn&#39;t discern the difference and instead concluded that he must be the last of his royal line that some mysterious force seeks to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. I cannot allow it. I must find our sacred land. Our true Kingdom. The only way is to connect with those who claim royal positions here in this region and beyond. I must rebuild our people.&lt;/i&gt; Crazy Cal made his was through the tangled forests to the nearest town and began his meager political campaign to recharge his royal line. Although he is not consciously aware of his Firbolg clan&#39;s monastic heritage, his muscle memory and reflexive training are embedded within him. A contradiction, this Firbolg monk is loud and brazen.&lt;/p&gt;
