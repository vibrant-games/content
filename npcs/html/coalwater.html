    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Hunted for transgressions against the Preistesses of Lollth [Any Drow Deity], Coalwater&#39;s family fled the Underdark and largely dispersed among the denizens of the Upperworld with the hope that they would remain out of the purview of their viscious condemners. Consequently, Coalwater was raised among the many races but conditioned to remain largely out of sight. Their family was constantly plagued with the anxiety of being found or sold out and, as such, spent a great deal of energy ensuring that their homesteads and places of business were non-descript and secure from prying eyes. Coalwater picked up on the many innovative techniques that their family would use to secure themselves from potential intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they matured, Coalwater would occasionally wander the market freely yet subtly, spying for goods or peoples who might help them better secure their homestead. It was during one of these outings that they connected with a few roughshod members of the local Thieves&#39; Guild. Quickly becoming friends over conversations about locks and tools, these three youth began to investigate means of overcoming the security of local businesses and magistrates. Calling it &#39;troubleshooting&#39;, they would often come into conflict with the local guards and militia. It was during these brief skirmishes that the three youth decided they would take it upon themselves to contract their skills and knowledge to the local elite with the slogan, &#39;Three Geese that will honk yer horn - If we can blow it, it need be reborn&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
