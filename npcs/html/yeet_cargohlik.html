    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;The hillside Dusk Goblins of Akhlo-Meek [Any major Goblin Village] remain relatively peaceful and rarely disrupt humanoid settlements beyond the hills. They are however plagued by raids from Underdark Goblins that emerge from the surrounding caves. These raids pose a serious threat, particularly because they result in captives being taken and enslaved. The Mountain Goblins aretactical in so far as they specifically target youth with the intention of converting them to following the increasingly violent and hate-fueled Goblinoid Deity Kyhaergebaerg [Any aggressive Goblinoid God]. Yeet was raised in this environment, inculcated with hatred for humanoid races and a desire to spill their blood, ravage their townships, and steal their shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeet might have been captured at the right time for conversion and subjected to viscious and violent &#39;therapies&#39;, but he is still able to remember that he is a Dusk goblin. He&#39;s able to reflect on an upbringing that promoted brotherhood and stability. Nonetheless, he has still been infused with the hatred and bloodlust that characterizes Underdark Goblins. He is characterized by this dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn into a raid of purportedly magical Dwarven caves by a tyrannical hobgoblin, Herkog, Yeet played a lieutenant role in controlling the captured Dwarves and staving off any intruders. Yet the mission went amiss when a group of adventurers from the nearby frontier town of Rheidolen [Any small frontier town] were comissioned to clear the caves and interrogate Herkog about his connections to the violent raids on surrounding towns. Herkog was slain and the goblin population eliminated. Except for Yeet. Because Herkog was slain before he could be questioned, this party of adventurers questioned Yeet instead. Yeet broke down and told them of how he is a Dusk Goblin and should never have been involved in this affair. He begged or his life and gave the adventuring party more than enough information to continue on with achieving their objectives. He was escorted back to Rheidolen for questioning and a potential trial but, because of the lack of security and organization in this frontier town, it was easy for such a crafty Goblin to escape. He now roams the wilderness and distant towns seeking other dusk Goblins.&lt;/p&gt;
