He remains well out of sight of guards and militia yet regularly has secret dealings with the middle to upper eschelons of local political factions. If adventurers passing through town appear to have valuable items or be capable of acquiring such items, he will contact them through secret letters via an innkeeper or bartender and arrange a meeting in a private place. He may also commission a particularly remarkable group to find certain valuable items.&quot;, &quot;appearance&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bridging on elderly looking; Worn skin and sunken features; Small poke tattoos on his face, neck, and hands; Wears a dusty old semi-formal outfit - Jacket, button-up, slacks, and boots; crewcut; small leather cap&quot;, &quot;expressions&quot;=&gt;&quot; \&quot;Can never make a truly fair trade - so might as well go with the flow\&quot;; \&quot;The things we do, the things we do...why do we do the things we do?\&quot;; \&quot;I once bought a large slice of land from a tribe of hobgoblins and sold it to an enemy tribe just to watch the party\&quot;;&quot;, &quot;mannerisms&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bows with a twirling wrist, sardonically, as if to say, &#39;you obviously will think you&#39;re better than me&#39;; Drops into a daze and traces ancient sigils in the air, only to fall still again; mild OCD - walks in patterns counting steps, opens a door at the count of three, obviously counts coins out loud during transactions, etc.&quot;}, &quot;acting&quot;=&gt;{&quot;motivations&quot;=&gt;&quot;The Con is known for using trade in valuable goods as a means for inciting conflict on a large scale.

During these extensive life-spans, they are susceptible to major life changes, whether in vocation, direction, location, or what-have-you. Nobody knows where the Con hails from, they only know that he is a Sylvan Elf because of his gaunt, lanky, and gruff appearance, ruddy skin and hair, and his bright silverish eyes. Nobody is sure what life trajectory brought the Pennymore Con to where he is today. The few things that are known about him could be myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Con is blamed across the Realm for various high-level robberies and for starting various skirmishes between nations by offering a contract on an important local Duke in exchange for a long-sought after item that had been fenced to him. Constantly seeking business with members of every eschelon of a city or town, the Con is open about his business dealings but opaque as to his motivations. Consequently, although suspected of high crimes, none have been proven and the Con is allowed free movement. In fact, his movement is likely advocated among higher magistrates because of the goods and services they&#39;ve obtained from him through less-than-legal means.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;}, &quot;uncategorized&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;wp:status&quot;=&gt;&quot;publish&quot;}]}}</p>	</div> <!-- property line -->
