      &lt;p&gt;As is well known across the Realms, Elves live a very long time. During these extensive life-spans, they are susceptible to major life changes, whether in vocation, direction, location, or what-have-you. Nobody knows where the Con hails from, they only know that he is a Sylvan Elf because of his gaunt, lanky, and gruff appearance, ruddy skin and hair, and his bright silverish eyes. Nobody is sure what life trajectory brought the Pennymore Con to where he is today. The few things that are known about him could be myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Con is blamed across the Realm for various high-level robberies and for starting various skirmishes between nations by offering a contract on an important local Duke in exchange for a long-sought after item that had been fenced to him. Constantly seeking business with members of every eschelon of a city or town, the Con is open about his business dealings but opaque as to his motivations. Consequently, although suspected of high crimes, none have been proven and the Con is allowed free movement. In fact, his movement is likely advocated among higher magistrates because of the goods and services they&#39;ve obtained from him through less-than-legal means.&lt;/p&gt;
