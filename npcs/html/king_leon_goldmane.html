    <div class="background-story">
      King Leon started out as a low-born soldier, however he quickly rose up the ranks with his natural talent and strength. He became known for his reputation as a powerful leader who commanded respect. After a while spent at this high position in the military, he completed a truly amazing feat of martial prowess . He became known for this deed throughout the land, and eventually word reached the king at the time, who had no heir to pass the crown to, so named Leon as his successor.
