									<p2>Maneuvers - You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one Ambush - When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren&#39;t incapacitated. Bait and Switch - When you&#39;re within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn&#39;t incapacitated. This movement doesn&#39;t provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled. Brace - When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you&#39;re wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon&#39;s damage roll. Commander&#39;s Strike - When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll.

Distracting Strike - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn. Evasive Footwork - When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving. Feinting Attack - You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll. Goading Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you.

Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check. Lunging Attack - When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll. Maneuvering Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack. Menacing Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Parry - When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier. Precision Attack - When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied. Pushing Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you. Quick Toss - As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the weapon&#39;s damage roll. Rally - On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier. Riposte - When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll. Sweeping Attack - When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack. Tactical Assessment - When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), an Intelligence (History), or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check. Trip Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack&#39;s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw.

									Yoloff has had a long and decorated career with the watch and is just waiting for his retirement pension to kick in so he can putter around his home full time. He knows the city like the back of his hand and has pretty much
sen it all. Despite his comments to the contrary, he actually enjoys and takes pride in training and keeping the rookies safe on the job. Due to his advanced age, most of his duties consist of training and crowd control on 
the few days that he gets away from pushing paper at his desk at Watch HQ. He's been a good watchman for a long long time, but has been known to take the odd bribe to supplement his income as long, as it's not to ignore 
something that will directly hurt anyone.

									Yoloff is tired. He's worked long and hard and is counting the days until his retirement. He's well known as one of the best trainers on the force and has cycled through many new recruits. He's been around the block more 
than a few times and knows both the city and the city's underworld inside and out.
