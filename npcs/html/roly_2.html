    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;A young and adventurous Minotaur engaged in a brutal and near life-ending battle with the clerics of Hamuun [Any deity, really] in defense of his prized possession - a holy relic the Minotaur had uncovered from cave fissures. The clerics had traveled a great distance in search of the relic and most certainly were not going to forego finding it in the caves as they had performed extensive research to locate it. They did not expect a guardian minotaur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missionaries did not wish to slay the beast as they discovered it had been charmed to guard the relic. In the battle, the Minotaur was clubbed hard to the skull in an attempt to subdue them. The Minotaur lost  consciousness and the clerics uncovered the relic and returned it, along with the Minotaur, to their temple district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minotaur came to consciousness in the presence of one of the healing priestesses of the Order - a beautiful gnomish woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;You will heal in time,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; she said gently. The Minotaur was overwhelmed with her beauty and overwhelmed with her gentle touch. The charm spell coupled with serious head trauma loosened the Minotaur from his memories and sense of identity. They internalized their caretaker and formed a new version of themself in their head - that of a helpful gnome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once fully recovered, and properly guided to an identifiable name, Roly, by their caretaker, they made their way about town looking to help others. The local innkeeper sympathized with Roly and offered them the position of Porter for the Inn. Roly&#39;s incredible service gained notoriety and local merchants and guilds began to enlist their services.&lt;/p&gt;
