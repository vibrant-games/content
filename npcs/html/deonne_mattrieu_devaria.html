								&lt;p&gt;Because of the imposing austerity of the Winterlands, the Orcs of the North, the Grimfang tribe, are known for being especially vicious.

They took him in as an adopted son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually finding Solace in the Church of the Poet of Justice [Hoar or some similar God of Revenge], Deonne has since committed his life to gaining retribution for the little known evils of the allied nations. While this serves as his over arching life-goal, he has settled himself into a rewarding juxtapositional life of providing comfort and respite to travelers of the Realms, dwarves and elves alike, to offer the comfort and compassion that he and his peoples never received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noble in presence, Deonne is committed to a life governed by natural law and the order civilization brings to the masses.
