    </div>

    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Because of the imposing austerity of the Winterlands, the Orcs of the North, the Grimfang tribe, are known for being especially vicious. Lines of berserkers, polar bear cavalries, and powerful shamans have carved bloody paths of devastation into the surrounding kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unknown to the broader public, the Grimfang tribe has derived their ruthlessness from a desire to protect themselves from the strategic and unethical assaults of the Northern Dwarven and Elven alliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separated from his tribe during a heavy skirmish, Deonne was held and tortured by the Inquisitors of the North seeking the hearth of the King of the Grimfang. Tortured over and over without giving up any information, he was abandoned for dead. Trudging through the bitter winter landscape, he eventually found a family of traveling merchants who took pity on the cowering, shivering youth hidden off the side of a trading route. They took him in as an adopted son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually finding Solace in the Church of the Poet of Justice [Hoar or some similar God of Revenge], Deonne has since committed his life to gaining retribution for the little known evils of the allied nations. While this serves as his over arching life-goal, he has settled himself into a rewarding juxtapositional life of providing comfort and respite to travelers of the Realms, dwarves and elves alike, to offer the comfort and compassion that he and his peoples never received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noble in presence, Deonne is committed to a life governed by natural law and the order civilization brings to the masses. Although resentful of the factions responsible for the unethical treatment of his tribe, he recognizes that town and city officials must bring order for their people, and he believes that religious factions are more capable of this than politicians and magistrates.&lt;/p&gt;
