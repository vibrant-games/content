    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Raised by an abusive human adopted father, Hylinn developed numerable psychological complexes. Her self-esteem and normally natural capabilities as an elf were largely lost during this train-wreck of an upbringing. Abandoning her in a marketplace when she was barely into her teen years certainly didn&#39;t help with any of these damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to survive, she took up the first available opportunity to support herself - a role as boatswain on a questionable ship of ne&#39;er-do-wells. Over the course of a number of voyages, she realized these &#39;sailors&#39; were second-rate pirates who would plunder minor textile and fabric shipments or something of equally laughable financial gain. The crew were, surprisingly, abusive - especially with her - and her disorders compounded. Fatter and drunker, Hylinn returned to land-based civilization as a quarter of half the person she might have been. But not without the Captain of the crew plucking out her right eye as a prize and also a punishment for abandoning the ship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking up various custodial and service jobs wherever she could in order to survive, or, rather, subsist, Hylinn focused most of her frustrations into her love for a good drunk and fatty foods. Her numerous disorders, perhaps too many to count, helps haughty and self-centered patrons feel better about themselves and thus drives a decent amount of business to the barstools in the tavern at which she works - &quot;the Dull Dragoon&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
