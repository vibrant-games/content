      &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Orcs aren&#39;t known for their navy. Yet that isn&#39;t to say that Orcs aren&#39;t sea-men. Born and raised by the Yellow Teeth tribe in the Northern Wastes of Kalauzumar [Any Remote Wasteland], Nagata was taught in swamp navigation and eventually in how to navigate the more shallow seas that surrounded the Wastelands. An ambitious young man, he dreamed of a life on the seas. But he knew this wouldn&#39;t be possible within the confines of his tribe. Although he tried his hands at engineering various war machines for his tribe and was actually quite talented at it, this couldn&#39;t possibly compare to his dreams of living a life on the high-seas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he loved his people, he loved the sea more. After yet another unecessarily violent raid by his tribe on a sea-side frontier town they made there way back towards the black swamps they deemed their home. Nagata was dismayed. He took a quick look around at the crew, made a broad and clearly unsuspicious gesture towards the starboard bow of the ship and whistled clearly (a known call for his shipmates) and then made a deliberate and unnoticeable dash to the port side of the ship diving off quietly into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagata swam to shore unnoticed and sat on his knees. He ran his fingers through the sand, muttering, &quot;dear sea, you have me&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
