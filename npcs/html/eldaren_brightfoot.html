			<h3>Combat Tactics</h3>
			<p>Although a performer, Eldaren is no newcomer to battle. He is quite crafty and will use his skills and/or magicks of persuasion to sway the battle in his favor after which time he can become quite ruthless.

			<h3>Roleplaying Tips</h3>
			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>Renown throughout the region for his passionate performances and people-centered political beliefs, numerous other townsfolk will suggest to any adventurers that they visit him to witness his great performances. He will also be pointed out as a connection for rebellious action with the goal of undercutting or removing local government officials and magistrates.</p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Appearance</h4>
			<p>Very handsome specimen; Polished amber curls fall to his shoulders or gets tied in a topknot (unless he&#39;s performing); Fashion savvy - wears bright colors contrasted with deep hues; Loves patterns - in clothing and otherwise;</p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Expressions</h4>
			<p> &quot;Everything comes together in a form or shape; a pattern. Everything has a pattern&quot;; &quot;Stay gleeful, glum chum. The world needs joy.&quot;; &quot;Did you see my performance of Lord Neverember in &#39;The Calling of Broken Arrows&#39;? I think everyone who&#39;s anyone has seen that.&quot;</p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Mannerisms</h4>
			<p>Although a physical actor, Eldaren is gentle and deliberate in his movements - his flourish only comes to the fore in performance or conflict; Knocks on wood; Almost always humming or whistling a tune - to the detriment of the nerves of others;</p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
			<h4>Motivations</h4>
			<p>Desires renown as the finest actor in the town/city/region. Hopes his performances invoke proclivities towards socialist political beliefs and away from monarchs and the aristocracy.
</p>
		</div> 
		
			
			<div class="actions">
			<h4>Passions</h4>
			<p>Acting, miming, singing, comedy; The greater good, to a fault; Socialism;
</p>
		</div> 
		
		<div class="actions">
<h4>Secrets</h4>
			<p></p>
		</div>

<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>&lt;p&gt;Always the ham of his large family, Eldaren had an innate talent to entertain others, whether that be through song, dance, or comedy. It simply came natural. His family were very supportive of this talent and young Eldaren quickly became a popular feature in his village performing in full-on stage productions, strumming a lute in the local tavern, or all-dressed-up in his famously ridiculous clowning garb and performing long mime sequences in the village square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His name eventually became known among other connected towns and cities. Eldaren&#39;s talents were requested by playwrights and tavern keepers throughout the region. He soon became a recognizable celebrity with passers-by remarking, &quot;I saw your performance of Gonidorin in &#39;the Leaves will Fall as they May!&quot; or something equally astounded. Only the erudite recognize that many of his performances have a hidden message promoting freeing the commoners from the clutches of the royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
