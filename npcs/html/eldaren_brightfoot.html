    <div class="background-story">
      &lt;p&gt;Always the ham of his large family, Eldaren had an innate talent to entertain others, whether that be through song, dance, or comedy. It simply came natural. His family were very supportive of this talent and young Eldaren quickly became a popular feature in his village performing in full-on stage productions, strumming a lute in the local tavern, or all-dressed-up in his famously ridiculous clowning garb and performing long mime sequences in the village square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His name eventually became known among other connected towns and cities. Eldaren&#39;s talents were requested by playwrights and tavern keepers throughout the region. He soon became a recognizable celebrity with passers-by remarking, &quot;I saw your performance of Gonidorin in &#39;the Leaves will Fall as they May!&quot; or something equally astounded. Only the erudite recognize that many of his performances have a hidden message promoting freeing the commoners from the clutches of the royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
