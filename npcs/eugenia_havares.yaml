# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

      "I'm not quite sure where Eugenia came from, or exactly when she arrived in town, but I seem to remember her tailor shop always being there... or maybe it just opened yesterday. But regardless, I'm absolutely positive that
      she's the best tailor and clothing designer I've ever seen and such a lovely beautiful person too. I can't believe she's not married yet", seems to be the answer you get from anyone you ask about the gorgeous red head
      in the tailor shop.

    personality: |
      Extremely petite and absolutely beautiful with a dazzling smile and a mop of curly red hair and expertly crafted clothes. Eugenia is sweet, gentle and reassuring. She takes the pride of an expert in her tailoring abilities.
      She is phenominal at her job and at the leading edge of fashion. There is somethine strange about her though. No one seems to know where she came from or when she arrrived, but whenever it was, her reputation as a 
      seamstress preceeded her. For all intents and purposes and to all forms of detection, Eugenia appears to be a non-magical human, but she is in fact some sort of ancient Fey and a master artificer.
