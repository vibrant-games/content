      <p><i>"I'm not quite sure where Eugenia came from, or exactly when she arrived in town, but I seem to remember her tailor shop always being there... or maybe it just opened yesterday. But regardless, I'm absolutely positive that she's the best tailor and clothing designer I've ever seen and such a lovely beautiful person too. I can't believe she's not married yet", </i>seems to be the answer you get from anyone you ask about the gorgeous red head in the tailor shop.</p>
