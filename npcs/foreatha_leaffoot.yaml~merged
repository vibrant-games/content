    background-story: |
      <p>Foreatha is a Wood Elf of around 400 years old. She has devoted the better part of her life to serving the stars and the Gods of Nature and learning the healing arts.  Daily, she comes in from the nearest forest to open her stall in the market square with fresh herbs to help and heal as many people as she can. She does charge for most of her services as they require time, materials and she does need money to survive, but her prices for herbs, lotions and potions are very reasonable and she has pretty much anything someone looking for that sort of thing can ask for.</p>

# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills:
   - - Elf Abilities:
        - Fey Ancestry: Advantage on saving throws againts charm and immune to sleep magic
        - Darkvision: Can see 60 in dim light as though it was bright light and in darkness as if it was dim light
        - Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill 
        - Trance: Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
                  dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep
                  
   - - Wood Elf Abilities:
        - Elf Weapon Training: You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow

        - Mask of the Wild: Can attempt to hide even when only lightly obscured by natural phenomenon 
        - Wood Elf Magic: Once per long rest can cast Guidance, Longstrider and Pass Without Trace without expending a spell slot. Spell DC

   - - Druid Abilities:
       - Druidic: You know Druidic, the Secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a Message. Others spot the 
                  message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.  
       - Spellcasting: DC 15
         Cantrips: Druidcraft, Mending, Produce Flame
         1st Level: Cure Wounds, Goodberry, Purify Food and Water, Entangle
         2nd Level: Lesser Restoration, Protection from Poison, Locates Animals or Plants
         3rd Level: Plant Growth, Speak with Plants, Call Lightning
         4th Level: Control Water, Confusion
       - Wild Shape: you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or Long Rest. Your druid level
                     determines the Beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd Level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a Challenge Rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a
                     flying or Swimming speed. You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. 
                     You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You automatically revert if you fall Unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die

   - - Circle of Stars Abilities:
         - Star Map: You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by
                     choosing one. While holding this map, you have these benefits - 
                     - You know the Guidance cantrip.
                     - You have the Guiding Bolt spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
                     - You can cast Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                     - If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.
         - Starry Form: you gain the ability to harness constellations’ power to alter your form. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast. 
                        While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light
                        in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. 
                        Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form - 
                        - Archer: A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous 
                                  arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
                        - Chalice: A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can 
                                   regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
                        - Dragon: A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 
                                  or lower on the d20 as a 10 
           Cosmic Omen: you learn to use your star map to divine the will of the cosmos. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest,
                        you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die - 
                        - Weal (even): Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to
                                       the total.
                        - Woe (odd): Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number
                                     rolled from the total

    background-story: |
      Foreatha is a Wood Elf of around 400 years old. She has devoted the better part of her life to serving the stars and the Gods of Nature and learning the healing arts.  Daily, she comes in from the nearest forest to open
      her stall in the market square with fresh herbs to help and heal as many people as she can. She does charge for most of her services as they require time, materials and she does need money to survive, but her prices for
      herbs, lotions and potions are very reasonable and she has pretty much anything someone looking for that sort of thing can ask for.
