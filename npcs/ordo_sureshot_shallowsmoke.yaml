      From the Harfoot subrace of Hobbits. Ordo was brought up by his parents but his parents died during a goblin raid, he was found by elves who took him in for several years and taught him their skills, he was esp good at scouting and was naturally as good as the best Elves. He showed an effortless ability with bow and knives.
