    background-story: |
      Slith'Kyrin has been trained since birth to be her people's next High Priestess of Bahamut. Still very young by her people's standards, she is full of self-doubt and questions, but is slowly coming into her own. She is strong and beautiful and very intelligent and knows how to play her role well. However, she has a dark and terrible secret; her race's creator, former patron, and still current patron of their sister race the Yuan-Ti, Zehir speaks to her. A dark reptilian old god, full of rage and hunger, Zehir wants his chosen people back from Bahamut. He fills her head with hunger and dark thoughts. She knows he is wrong and was a cruel master to her people, but she struggles to keep his seductive words from her mind as her power grows.
