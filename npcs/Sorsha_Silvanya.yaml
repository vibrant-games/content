# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Sorsha Silvanya is roughly 400 years old and spent a long time as a spy for her people in lands of men. About 70 or so years ago, she discovered an interest in artifice, especially in communication technologies. She not 
      only sees it as an avenue to improve her reconnaissance skills, but as a potential way to improve society as a whole and possibly make a significant amount of money. Her work in developing these technologies attracted 
      the attention of Oswald Vardklemp and the Collegium, She saw it as an opportunity to advance her work and to keep an eye the other members and their work. She has a strong woking knowledge of communication magics but 
      is attempting to develop communication technologies that don't require the use of magic (ie. telephony) so they are available for all people.

    #
    personality: |
      Sorsha Silvanya is a shorter, thin, High Elf with long light-brown hair that she almost always wear pinned-up in a bun. She has pretty, but sharp features, a youthful appearance that belies her actual age. She is cool and 
      cunning. Reserved, but capable of playing at personable and pleasant.  She carries herself with the standard High Elf snootiness, but for her it's more of an air that she uses to hide her ruthlessness. She does however 
      have a streak of altruism and does ligitimately want to use the technology she is developing to benefit society as a whole, not just for her own and her people's benefits
