# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    introduction:  This sketchy old elf is something of a myth more than a man. He remains well out of sight of guards and militia yet regularly has secret dealings with the middle to upper eschelons of local political factions. If adventurers passing through town appear to have valuable items or be capable of acquiring such items, he will contact them through secret letters via an innkeeper or bartender and arrange a meeting in a private place. He may also commission a particularly remarkable group to find certain valuable items.

      The "Pennymore Con" is in search of a magic stone with sigils carved into it. It passed through his fencing shop and in the process captured an aspect of his soul. He doesn't know what it does but he knows it will bring him riches at the expense of others so he never says anything, but instead dreams of it night and day.

   - - Elf Abilities:
        - Fey Ancestry: Advantage on saving throws againts charm and immune to sleep magic

        - Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill 
        - Trance: Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
                  dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep
        - Elf Weapon Training: You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
        - Fleet of Foot: Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

       - Expertise: Double proficiency bonus with Thieve's Tools and Sleight of Hand
       - Sneak Attack: Once per turn can add 3d6 to one creature she hits with a ranged or finesse attack if she has advantage on the attack or if the target is engaged with another creater
       - Cunning Action: Can tak a bonus action on each turn to Hide, Disengage or Dash
       - Uncanny Dodge: When an attacker she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her Reaction to halve the damage 
       - Evasion: When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail
                            
   - - Thief Abilities:
       - Fast Hands: you can use the Bonus Action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to Disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.
       - Second-Story Work: you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra Movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to 
                            your Dexterity modifier.
       - Supreme Sneak: you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

      The Con will engage in combat with a smile, first using his acrobatics to parkour and disorient unsuspecting combatants.
    special-equipment:
    - Bullwhip of Entanglement: 1d6+5 Force Damage. If you hold one end of the whip and use an action to speak its Command Word, the other end darts forward to Entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target 
                                must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become Restrained. You can release the creature by using a Bonus Action to speak a second Command Word. A target Restrained by the rope can use 
                                an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer Restrained by the rope. The rope has AC 20 and 20 Hit Points. It regains 1 hit 
                                point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
    - Quaals Feather Token: Whip, You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a Bonus Action to make a melee spell Attack
                            against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an Attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage. As a Bonus Action on Your Turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet
                            and repeat the Attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are Incapacitated or die

    #
    background-story: |
     As is well known across the Realms, Elves live a very long time. During these extensive life-spans, they are susceptible to major life changes, whether in vocation, direction, location, or what-have-you. Nobody knows where
     the Con hails from, they only know that he is a Sylvan Elf because of his gaunt, lanky, and gruff appearance, ruddy skin and hair, and his bright silverish eyes. Nobody is sure what life trajectory brought the Pennymore Con
     to where he is today. The few things that are known about him could be myth. The Con is blamed across the Realm for various high-level robberies and for starting various skirmishes between nations by offering a contract on
     an important local Duke in exchange for a long-sought after item that had been fenced to him. Constantly seeking business with members of every eschelon of a city or town, the Con is open about his business dealings but
     opaque as to his motivations. Consequently, although suspected of high crimes, none have been proven and the Con is allowed free movement. In fact, his movement is likely advocated among higher magistrates because of the
     goods and services they've obtained from him through less-than-legal means.

      
    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     The Con is a shifty fellow. Cautious and brazen at the same time, he carries out his business out in the open but keeps his motives to himself. The Con's reputation is almost entirely based on myth as nobody has actually 
     spent enough time with him or knows him well enough for it to be anything else. He keeps himself to himself and keeps everybody else at arms reach.
