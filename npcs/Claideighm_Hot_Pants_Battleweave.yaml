# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills:
   - - Duergar Abilities:
       - Superior Darkvision: See 120 in like bright light in dim light and like dim light in darkness
       - Duergar Resilience: Advantage on saving throws against illusions and phantasms and against being charmed, paralyzed, and poisoned with alchemical poisons
       - Sunlight Sensitivity: disadvantage on attack and perception roles in direct sunlight
       - Duergar Magic: Can cast Enlarge and Invisibility once per long rest with intelligence as spellcasting ability
       - Duergar Weapons Training: Proficient with Battleaxe, Handaxe, Light Hammer and Warhammer
    
   - - Warlock Traits: Pact of the Hexblade: 
       - Cantrips: Eldritch Blast, Toll The Dead 
       - 1st Level: Charm Person, Hex
       - 2nd Level: Crown of Madness, Enthrall
       - Eldritch Invocations: 
         - Rebuke of the Talisman: When the wearer of your talisman is hit by an attacker you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal psychic damage to the attacker equal to your proficiency bonus 
                                  and push it up to 10 feet away from the talisman's wearer
         - Maddening Hex: As a bonus action, you cause a psychic disturbance around the target cursed by your Hex spell or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblade’s Curse and Sign of Ill Omen. When you do so, you deal 
                         psychic damage to the cursed target and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The psychic damage equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage). To use this invocation, you must be able 
                         to see the cursed target, and it must be within 30 feet of you                                  
    
   - - The Raven Queen Abilities:
       - Raven Queen Spells: Spell DC 14
             1st Level: False Life, Sanctuary
             2nd Level: Silence, Spiritual Weapon
             3rd Level: Feign Death, Speak with Dead     
       - Sentinel Raven: you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give 
                         telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to 
                         Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can’t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it 
                         can’t take damage; and it is incapacitated. You can see through the raven’s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it
                         acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours. The raven doesn’t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you
                         from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you,
                         no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.

    background-story: |
      A young Dwarven boy grew up in the mining village of Duncarve. Raised in a family of 'second-handers' - bandsmen and drags-men who would load and operate the mining carts - he was subjected to a mundane life of daily 
      servitude. Load the cart. Steer the cart. Unload the cart. It was exhausting. He grew especially tired of watching the purveyors of the mine increase the quality of their lifestyle and of the increased riches of the 
      merchants and oresmen who would deal in the precious materials Claideighm would cart around. Bah! He thought to himself. This is no way to live. A slave to the gold and servile to those who deal in it.
      The hypermasculine environment of the mines and mercantile trading classes that frequented his family shop crept under his skin. Under his skin. That's a place he would rarely visit. When he did, he knew he was out of 
      place. And not just because of his distaste for servitude. No. It was his distaste for himself. This was not who he was really meant to be. Claideighm decided to run away at an early age before he was further 
      inculcated into the unescapable lifestyle and traditions of his village. He followed a merchant caravan to a nearby city and was suddenly exposed to sights and sounds, flavors and scents, skin tones and textures, that 
      he'd never seen before. His psyche was on fire. In a short period of time in the city Claideighm created a new narrative for himself. One that fit. He recognized that his natural figure was more attractive to the 
      males of the races. He realized that sex and his hunger for it was a commodity under his control rather than under the control of some mercantile class. He redeemed his soul the moment he found and purchased his 
      first runed pants and placed his slender frame in a the shadows of the streets for passing merchants to admire. His increasing androgyny worked in his favor. They exploited them for their money at every turn and began to 
      identify themself as neither man nor woman.They are now well-known as one of the most charming 'courtesans' in the major cities of the region.
