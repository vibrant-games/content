# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Primo named himself. Born Salanar Kholemdia, he had a natural knack for cooking and an imaginative way of interacting with and serving others. He seemed destined for a life in the kitchen. On a fine summer's day he strolled
     through the local marketplace and caught a glimpse of a local artist displaying his work. The artist was surrounded by paramours and admirers and sat leisurely in the sun. Goodness. That sure beats slaving in the heat. 
     He thought to himself. After many nights of prayer for the life of a prosperous artist to what seemed silent gods, Salanar instead turned to roaming through the small temple district of his home town. There he questioned
     the holy men and women why his prayers went unanswered. "The God's won't respond to selfishness. Our pantheon honors the disiplined accrual of experience and provides fecund rewards for such" one notable priest replied.
     "Well, who might grant me my wish?" Salanar inquired. "You. You can." the high priest responded resolutely. Bullshit, he thought, trudging back to perform his duties in the kitchen. If only I could have that life. I'd give
     anything. That night, after a long shift stewing meats and cleaning surfaces, Salanar had a vision in his sleep of a decayed ancient elf in regal robes and ancient chain, its face sunken with black opal eyes staring
     straight into Salanar's bone marrow. Quiet your pleas for more, boy. I'll give you all you wish for... Petrified and unable to wake, Salanar sunk deeper into the dream. You only need to pledge your very being to me through
     life and into death. The figure made a broad gesture to one side and Salanar's mind was filled with an infinite number of beautiul works of art pouring over one another again and again, and again and again, and his heart
     filled with the hope to become the artist he always wanted. His very bones agreed to Kiaransalee's terms. When he awoke the next morning, Salanar was filled with such confidence and inspiration that he began demanding that
     others call him 'Primo'. He proceeded to fill the taverns, markets, and streets with his labor and produce volumes of art. Little did he expect, he became haunted by undeath. Ghosts, wraiths, and more, peer around corners,
     over window sills, and over his bed while he sleeps.

    personality: |
     Primo, as he refers to himself, is a smug and preening narcissist. He flaunts his talents and craves the praise of his adoring public. His deal has given him exceptional talents and he knows it. Unfortunately, his deal has
     also left him haunted and paranoid, terrified that the family he sacrificed for his talent will come for him.
