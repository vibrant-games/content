# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     The remote frontier towns of Errk, Cloh, and Mont Ire, are closely interconnected shanty-style communities within a short travel from one another amidst the mountainous pseudo-desert landscapes of the Eves of Tomorrow [any
     semi-Wasteland area]. They are close enough to have established a makeshift government and militia. A much needed pact to manage the roving bands of marauders and various monstrosities that populate the wastes. Rahim grew
     up in this challenging environment and wed his sweetheart, Mallum. The two have made a name for themselves as propritors of one of the finest rest stops in the region where they offer some of the finest consumables around,
     serving fine grub and wines and, with their deep cellar, one of the few purveyors of flavored ices for hundreds of miles

    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Rahim is a kind and generous man. He and his wife work hard to provide the highest level of hospitality to their guests. By nature, he is a very nervous and anxious sort, and has a serious stutter because of it. Aside from
     his anxiety, Rahim has proved to be an astute and capable business man and has developed my contacts throughout his community
