# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    #
    background-story: |
     The bustling multi-racial city of Everskaard [Any major multi-racial city] is famous for it's innovative mercantile classes and its capacities for importing and exporting goods of all kinds from throughout the region. The
     craftspeople of Everskaard never relent to traditional ways of fashioning goods and instead inspire one another, with their fervent work ethics and near constant invention, to recreate the ways that things get made. Rainbow
     is an exemplar of these ideals. While their lineage is that of smiths, Rainbow abandoned metals and forges in favor of finding ways in which to weave together hides and woods to be just as sturdy and effective as irons and
     steels. She operates as a very unorthodox 'Smithy', heating woods and hids in her alternate style forge to bend and shape and harden them into innovative, light, and durable armors and weapons.

    #
    personality: |
     Rainbow is an unorthodax individual. Passionate with a hot streak, she is innovative and exploratory with her smith and works hard to develop new techniques for her industry. Unfortunately her explosive anger and hot temper
     make her life far more difficult than it needs to be. She can't keep employees, doesn't have much in the way of friends and even has trouble keeping busines relationships functioning. If she wasn't so good at what she does,
     she'd have been out of business a long time ago
