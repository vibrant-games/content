# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Changeling (Eberron) Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Change Appearance
    - content: As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.
               You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make
               yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if
               you’re bipedal, you can’t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don’t change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to
               keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.
               Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) 
               check you make to avoid detection.
    - title: Unsettling Visage
    - content: When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses.
               Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest
    - title: Divergent Persona
    - content: You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a unique identity associated with that proficiency; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of
               this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency
  - title: Rogue Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Expertise
    - content: Double proficiency bonus with Thieve's Tools and Sleight of Hand
    - title: Sneak Attack
    - content: Once per turn can add 3d6 to one creature she hits with a ranged or finesse attack if she has advantage on the attack or if the target is engaged with another creater
    - title: Cunning Action
    - content: Can take a bonus action on each turn to Hide, Disengage or Dash
    - title: Uncanny Dodge
    - content: When an attacker she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her Reaction to halve the damage 
    - title: Evasion
    - content: When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail
  - title: Spy Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Tricks of the Trade
    - content: Proficiency in Disguise, Forgery, Poison Kits, Tinker's Tools and Gadget Box
    - title: Imposter
    - content: You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing and bahavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these components of these behaviors. Your ruse is your indiscernible to the
               casual observer. If a weary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to avoid detection
    - title: Gadget Box
    - content: Allows you to use specific spells of your choosing and can be used identically to Thieve's Tools or Tinker's Tools, Spellcasting is not intrinisc to the spy and that without the Gadget Box, the Spy may not 
               use Gadget Box spellcasting.
    - content: Gadget Box Spellcasting
    - content: Cantrip 
    - content: 1st Level 
    - content: 2nd Level 
    - content: Gadget Box Self Destruct Mode - You can set a delay between 1 second and 24hrs. During that time the gadget box cannot be open by any means and cannot be used. At the end of that duration all creatures within
                                               60ft must make a Constitution saving throw or take Xd6 force damage and be knocked prone, where X is your Rogue Level. Taking half damage on a successful save. It takes 1 weeks 
                                               using tinker's tools to build a new box

  - title: Attacks
  - content: 1 attack with Poison Dagger
  - title: Combat Tactics
  - content: Stealth and Surprise

  - title: Special Equipment
  - abilities:
    - title: Gadget Box
    - content: see above
    - title: Poison Dagger
    - content: This dagger contains a small reservoir in the handle to keep the blade coated in fluid, usually some form of poison, ideal for assassins who need to poison multiple targets in quick succession. The altered shape 
               of the dagger to make room for the fluid inside makes it impractical for throwing, however.
    - content: Poison Reserve - Thanks to the cavity inside this dagger, it can hold up to two doses of poison when poison is applied to it. For obvious reasons, you cannot store two poisons of different types within this weapon
               at the same time.

    background-story: |
      They grew up as an exile as most of their race do. They tend to be met with distrust and persecution even by those of their own kind. Gex has has always had a call to being a performer, but when in their late teens they
      were found out to be a changeling, they were run out of town by the very audience they craved. At that point, they were approached and taken in by a spy master and trained in the ways of information gathering and when it
      comes to that calling, there is no one better
