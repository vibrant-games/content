    background-story: |
      They grew up as an exile as most of their race do. They tend to be met with distrust and persecution even by those of their own kind. Gex has has always had a call to being a performer, but when in their late teens they were found out to be a changeling, they were run out of town by the very audience they craved. At that point, they were approached and taken in by a spy master and trained in the ways of information gathering and when it comes to that calling, there is no one better
