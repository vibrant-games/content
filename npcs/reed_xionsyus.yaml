# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Orcish raids certainly aren't limited to Western Realms. As the orcs expand their grip on the land through broad diasporas above and below ground, the far-east has experienced similar challenges. Plunder, pillage, bloodshed,
     and, unfortunately, rape, are all among the impacting factors. Reed is a product of these raids. Raised in a semi-noble house of militant samurai, Reed's natural abilities became apparent to his family and their samurai
     masters. He was a natural fit for their training and military crusades. Over time, Reed's clan spread far and wide in their explorations and claims to various regions. His soul has become that of a wanderer. Make no
     mistake, however, because Reed is not a Ronin. He stands devout in his devotion to his family and their military objectives, acting as a diplomat, messenger, and trader of their fine goods. Often receiving mass imports from
     his home, he busies his days refining and sophisticating his market booth and managing his inventory to best provide an authentic experience of his culture.

    #
    personality: |
     Reed is a dutiful and devoted son. He is proud of his family and heritage and works hard to make his market stall a refection of that pride. He is also a skilled and patient warrior who studies and uses his enemies 
     weaknesses against them
