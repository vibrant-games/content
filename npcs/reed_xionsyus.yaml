    background-story: |
      <p>Orcish raids certainly aren't limited to Western Realms. As the orcs expand their grip on the land through broad diasporas above and below ground, the far-east has experienced similar challenges. Plunder, pillage, bloodshed, and, unfortunately, rape, are all among the impacting factors.</p><p>Reed is a product of these raids. Raised in a semi-noble house of militant samurai, Reed's natural abilities became apparent to his family and their samurai masters. He was a natural fit for their training and military crusades.</p><p>Over time, Reed's clan spread far and wide in their explorations and claims to various regions. His soul has become that of a wanderer. Make no mistake, however, because Reed is not a Ronin. He stands devout in his devotion to his family and their military objectives, acting as a diplomat, messenger, and trader of their fine goods.</p><p>Often receiving mass imports from his home, he busies his days refining and sophisticating his market booth and managing his inventory to best provide an authentic experience of his culture.</p>
