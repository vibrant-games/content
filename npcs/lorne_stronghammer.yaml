    background-story: |
      <p> Lorne was raised in the SimmeredAshes [Large Mountain Range] Mountain range. His parents were devout worshippers of Hysdomman, the Father of Shields [Any powerful Central Dwarven God] and highly traditional. They were harsh on him, but fair, and always urged him to keep his hands busy in his own business, not others. As talented and renown smiths, his family were also able to offer Lorne a lush and more-than-comfortable lifestyle. He thus absorbed and internalized the priority of wealth and proprietorship.</p><p>Although among the upper class of his city, Lorne had watched his parents relentless toiling upon the anvils and forges. He learned that comfort is the result of long days of tireless labour. As his parents aged he began to take the roles of proprietor and designer of Stronghammer Arms. To this day, he swears by his name and lives for his brand</p>
