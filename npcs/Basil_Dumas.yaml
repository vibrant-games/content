# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Basil Dumas is the oldest son of Anastasia and the money man of the family. He handles all of the banking and investments of the Dumas Family. He was taught by his father, who ammassed the family fortune as a landlord
      and moneylender before his untimely death, the ways of the financial world.  He is a brilliant financial mind and shrewd businessman, and uses that to the benefit of the family, often investing in businesses and organization in return for 
      favors for the family. When he was a young man, he closed a business deal that evicted an elderly lady and her family. As a result, The lady cursed Basil with the curse of Lycanthropy. Over the years he has managed to 
      gain mastery over the curse, banding it to his will and like all things in his life, to his advantage.

    #
    personality: |
      Basil Dumas is an aging human man. Short, thin and balding, with a whispy comb-over and pointy features. He is always impeccably dressed in fine business attire. He is brusque, impatient and overly self-important. He has a 
      cunning head for business and a cunning sense for the hunt. His wolf and half-wolf forms are still short for a lycanthrope, but heavily muscled and covered in a thick silver-gray coat fur. He wears glasses when in his 
      human form although he does not need them because of his lycanthropic senses.
