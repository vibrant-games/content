    background-story: |
      <p>Tony is the stereotypical pawn shop owner. He's sleazy, greedy and ill-tempered. But if you're looking for stolen goods or to sell something in a pinch, Tony's your go to guy. You're never going to get a lot for what you're selling, and you're going to pay way to much for anything you're buying, but he'll definitely get you what you need, no questions asked. Tony is well known in the underworld and a card carrying member of the local thieves' guild. He's a pretty big fish, but he's definitely a bottom feeder.</p>
