# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Tony is the stereotypical pawn shop owner. He's sleazy, greedy and ill-tempered. But if you're looking for stolen goods or to sell something in a pinch, Tony's your go to guy. You're never going to get a lot for what you're
     selling, and you're going to pay way to much for anything you're buying, but he'll definitely get you what you need, no questions asked. Tony is well known in the underworld and a card carrying member of the local thieves'
     guild. He's a pretty big fish, but he's definitely a bottom feeder.
      
    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Tony is scum. He's greedy, he's rude, he's cheap, he's mean and he's completely devoid of empathy. He's also a coward and is easily bought or intimidated. If he ever finds himself in real danger he'll lock himself into his 
     own safe and wait for backup. He is however, one hell of a negotiator and will always bargain for the lowest buying price and highest selling price possible for any good coming or going from his shop
