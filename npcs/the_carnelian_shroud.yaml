# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     The Carnelian Shroud is actually Maria Estivan, a formerly well known traveling actress and orphanage benefactor. Her career ended when she and her husband were attacked on the road one night. He was slain and her face was 
     scarred. With no husband or career to support her or the orphanage they had just built together, Maria put her acting and makeup skills to work for her and created The Carnelian Shroud and began robbing wagons and carriages
     on horseback. As she became more and more successful, she began to recruit groups of struggling young men and sending them out into the country side in gangs to continue raising funds so she had to venture out less and less
     and could spend more time focusing on her orphanage. As the legend grew, so did the income. Now every cent that isn't being paid to her men in the field is anonymously donated to orphanages around the countryside.

    personality: |
     The Carnelian Shroud is confident and boastful with a dramatic flair. Bold and defiant, they will not shy away from attacking any caravan with enough preperation. Darkly mysterious, there are very few people who know The
     Shroud's true identity. They are extremely charismatic and have had no trouble amassing followers to their cause. Maria Estivan on the other hand is a kind, generous and demure woman. As a former actor, she does have a
     flair for the dramatic, but she does her best to keep that under wraps now adays. She works hard to provide a decent life for the orphans she supports through her endavours and has been successful enough in her
     "alternative career" to support many orphanages throughout the countryside
