# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

   - - Madness Domain Abilities: 
       - Divine Hallucinations: you can use an action to enter a catatonic trance to receive warnings from your god via hallucination. You become incapacitated for 1 minute as you experience a vivid hallucination that might be 
                                prophetic. The DM rolls a d6 in secret. On a roll of a 5 or 6, the DM shows you a likely future involving a real threat you're likely to face soon. On any other roll the DM shows you a paranoid 
                                vision of an unlikely future involving threats that are not real or that you're unlikely to face, such as a betrayal from allies that are actually trustworthy, or an attack from monsters that 
                                aren't actually present in the immediate area. You can enter this trance a number of times equal to your cleric level divided by 4 (a minimum of once). 
       - Gift of Madness: level you also learn how to ward off attackers by sharing your madness with them. Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to assault it with hallucinations. 
                          The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes psychic damage equal to 2 + half your cleric level and the hallucinations make it either blinded or deafened (your choice)
                          and frightened of you until the end of your next turn. You can use this reaction ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once).
       - Dread Whispers: you can use your Channel Divinity to infuse the creatures in an area with paranoid dread and maddening whispers warning them of betrayal As an action, you choose a point that you can see within 60 feet. 
                         Each creature in a 10 foot sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes psychic damage equal to ld6 + half your cleric level and it becomes 
                         addled with dread for 1 minute. A creature addled with this dread treats all other creatures as enemies for the purpose of disadvantage for ranged attacks, and must make any opportunity attack it 
                         possibly can. At the end of an affected creature's turn, it repeats the saving throw. A success ends the effect on that creature.
       - Crazed Stumbling: when you deal psychic damage to a creature you can cause it to stagger with fear and confusion. You can choose to push it up to 10 feet in any direction that it can move, but you cannot move it further
                           than half its speed
       - Potent Spellcasting: you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

    background-story: |
      Delores Dumas is the Daughter of Anastasia Dumas and mother of Nicodeamus and Irini Dumas. Delores grew up under her mother's cruel thumb and was prone to rebellion. At the age of 19 she met Saul Branstock and soon 
      became pregnant, giving birth to her first child, Nicodeamus. Upon his birth, he was immediately taken from her by her grandmother and Saul helped her flee from her family. Her and Saul lived happily for many years 
      though she always missed her son. One day a young familiar stranger arrived at their home. This stranger proceeded to put her in chains, gun down her husband and burn down their home. On their way back to the family 
      home Delores was horrified to learn that this cold-hearted youth was in fact, Nicodeamus, all grown up. This event was the first large blow to her sanity. Her vicious son tortued and tormented her the entire way back 
      to the ancestral family home. Once she was home, the family kept her locked and chained away in the basement shrine to their master. After several months chained in solitude, Anastasia offered up her daughter as tribute 
      to the family patron. The devil took Delores to his realm and impregnanted her, shattering her mind completely and irrivocably. Upon her return, now thoroughly mad, Delores gave birth to a daughter, half human, half 
      devil. Anastasia named her Irini and promised her to Nicodeamus. In her madness, the horrifying things she has experienced have also given her a kind of clarevoyance and has made her a prophet of sorts. She regularly 
      has vision, omens and portents of things to come and events happening far away. Because of this, the family has kept her alive and prisoner in their sanctum. Delores frequently escapes from her prison, often at the at 
      the expense of her own health, and often leads the rest of the family on a merry chace, but is always captured again and brought back to her prison. Anastasia also uses Delores' blood as a regular offering to the family 
      patron, each time giving more of her soul to the master.

    #
    personality: |
      Delores Dumas is always manic, disheveled and glassy-eye. Her red hair is always a mess and she is barely clothed, basically wearing a dirty gray long nightshirt. She always has her hands bound in manacles keep her from 
     that double any kind of magical travel, but also double as her spellcasting focus allowing her to cast spells without any other spell components. Delores is quite mad and barely coherent. In her more lucid moments she 
     tries to escape from her family, but is always brought back. At best, she speaks in riddles, at worst, in complete gibberish. Because of her broken mind, she cannot be charmed or contorlled in any way and is immune to 
     psychic damage. Delores isn't particularly aggressive, more just frantic. She will not attack anyone or anything unless she is directly attacked herself, but due to her mania, she will unwittingly cast spells such as 
     Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Fear, or Otto's Irresistable Dance on random targets in her vacinity. If she is directly attacked she will respond with the full force of her psychic magic. Unfortunately for her, because of 
     her "special" relationship with the Dumas Family's Patron, none of her magic has any effect on her blood relatives. Everyone else, including non-blood related family, is fair game forher power.
