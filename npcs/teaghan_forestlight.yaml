# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    #
    background-story: |
     In a moody drawl, Teaghan lists off the provisions ordered by the head of the local militia. Their defense of Synon-Dor [Any major city] requires that each and every militia member is well-fed and Teaghan is aware of this
     and her important role in the defense of the city. She is, after all, the primary provisioner for the militia. Raised in the farmlands surrounding the city that were provisioned by Baron Korimir Havensloch upon the 
     inception of his oligarchical rule, Teaghan spent her early years as a farmhand on the farmlands of her immediate and extended family. When the threat of encroaching waves of Hobgoblins and Orcs threatened the security of
     the city, the militia required more streamlined channels for sundries and provisions. The Baron chose the Forestlight family as the primary provisioner and Teaghan's family were locked into the role.

    #
    # Required.

    #
    personality: |
     Teaghan is a young woman with the wrong family. She longs for adventure and excitement but her family keeps her grounded and in the family business. She is very good at what she does and is exceptional at accounting and
     mathematics. Her job is clearly her calling, but she hates it all the same and would way rather be out having the adventures than provisioning others to have them
