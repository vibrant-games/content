    background-story: |
      <p>In a moody drawl, Teaghan lists off the provisions ordered by the head of the local militia. Their defense of Synon-Dor [Any major city] requires that each and every militia member is well-fed and Teaghan is aware of this and her important role in the defense of the city. She is, after all, the primary provisioner for the militia.</p><p>Raised in the farmlands surrounding the city that were provisioned by Baron Korimir Havensloch upon the inception of his oligarchical rule, Teaghan spent her early years as a farmhand on the farmlands of her immediate and extended family. /p><p>When the threat of encroaching waves of Hobgoblins and Orcs threatened the security of the city, the militia required more streamlined channels for sundries and provisions. The Baron chose the Forestlight family as the primary provisioner and Teaghan's family were locked into the role.</p>
