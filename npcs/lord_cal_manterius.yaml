# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Wandering through the woods, Cal Manterius realized that he had no idea where he was or where he was going. The brain fog imposed by that Green Hag who was haunting his village lingered. Was there a hag? What village?
      Cal's mind tumbled through what he thought were memories but wouldn't stop tumbling. He was getting dizzy. Stop tumbling! He cried out in his mind. He stumbled into a clearing in the woods where ruined buildings from a
      long razed village jutted out of the landscape like giant skeletal fingers reaching for the freedom of the sky. Is this where I was headed? Cal looked about. Seemed like a place that one might look for. He set up a
      makeshift camp, chewed down some jerky and tack, and grabbed himself a nice sleep. Upon waking, Cal's mind filled with wonder and glee that he had found what he had been searching for. This is it! But why was I searching
      for this place? Cal searched the area further only to find burnt Firbolg bones and burnt equipment. They did it again! They silenced us. We mustn't allow this! He thought to himself. His mind turned inward upon itself.
      All his memories of living and growing up in a regal Firbolg village became muddled together with his recent explorations. He couldn't discern the difference and instead concluded that he must be the last of his royal
      line that some mysterious force seeks to end. No. I cannot allow it. I must find our sacred land. Our true Kingdom. The only way is to connect with those who claim royal positions here in this region and beyond. I must
      rebuild our people. Crazy Cal made his was through the tangled forests to the nearest town and began his meager political campaign to recharge his royal line. Although he is not consciously aware of his Firbolg clan's
      monastic heritage, his muscle memory and reflexive training are embedded within him. A contradiction, this Firbolg monk is loud and brazen.

    #
    personality: |
      Lord Cal is slightly on the crazy side. He may have been cursed or recieved a head injury, but his memory is not what it should be and he slides in and out of delusions and dementia. He is bold and persistent in his
      mission to rebuild his royal line, whether or not that royal line actually exisits is another matter entirely.
