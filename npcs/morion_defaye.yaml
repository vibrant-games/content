# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     As a high priest of Waukeen [or any other God of Civilization or Mercantile/Capitalist Communities], Morion believes in the power of venture capitalism, mercantile culture, and clear divisions of labour. He is a champion
     of this clergy and a warrior for its causes. He grew up in a High Elven community committed to the establishment of the ideals that insist that 'civilized' societies must rely on a clear division of labor; a clarity
     which can only be achieved by relying on the power of wealth as the primary feature for division. To these clergy, trade of coin and goods is central to maintaining law and order and, as such, the church has dedicated
     champions to protecting marketplaces, caravans, and any other vectors for the spread of capitalism. They have established powerful 'armies' of warrior abbots and priests, adorned in lush tunics of grey and white highlighted
     with rare coins sewn into the fabrics. Morion has spent his many years dedicated to this clergy. Battling surrounding nations as a warrior priest, He has gained notoriety for his ruthlessness and divinely imbued
     abilities. Even within the hierarchy. These clergy literally battle one on one for advancement to the upper echelons. And Morion has gained a reputation as a dangerous opponent and dedicated member of the community.
     The upper clergy consist primarily of Elves and Humans while the lower echelons are made up of the same plus a large proportion of Warforged created by gifted High Elf and Human devout. When he is not engaged in complex
     rituals and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal at the Mercantile Temple, Morion is most often found escorting high-value trade caravans through distant trade routes. He is often accompanied by a small battalion of warforged
     dedicated to the mercantile clergy. Morion is quite fond of one particular follower, Cure.

    personality: |
      Morion is smug and self-important to the point of arrogance. While he is known as an accomplished fighter, his arragonce does occasionally lead to overestimating his own abilities. Unfortunately he's never really learned
      this lesson due to being surrounded by his retinue of Warforged that have insullated him from the conseuences of his overconfidence. He is unquestioningly and unwaiveringly devoted to his religion which has lead him to
      look down on lesser people, the poor, and the "savages" of societies that aren't completely devoted and organized around commerce.
