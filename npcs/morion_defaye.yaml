    background-story: |
      <p>As a high priest of Waukeen [or any other God of Civilization or Mercantile/Capitalist Communities], Morion believes in the power of venture capitalism, mercantile culture, and clear divisions of labour. He is a champion of this clergy and a warrior for its causes. He grew up in a High Elven community committed to the establishment of the ideals that insist that 'civilized' societies <i>must</i> rely on a clear division of labor; a clarity which can only be achieved by relying on the power of wealth as the primary feature for division.</p><p>To these clergy, trade of coin and goods is central to maintaining law and order and, as such, the church has dedicated champions to protecting marketplaces, caravans, and any other vectors for the spread of capitalism. They have established powerful 'armies' of warrior abbots and priests, adorned in lush tunics of grey and white highlighted with rare coins sewn into the fabrics</p><p>Morion has spent his many years dedicated to this clergy. Battling surrounding nations as a warrior priest, He has gained notoriety for his ruthlessness and divinely imbued abilities. Even within the hierarchy. These clergy literally battle one on one for advancement to the upper echelons. And Morion has gained a reputation as a dangerous opponent and dedicated member of the community.</p><p>The upper clergy consist primarily of Elves and Humans while the lower echelons are made up of the same plus a large proportion of Warforged created by gifted High Elf and Human devout.</p><p>When he is not engaged in complex rituals and prayer to the Marketplace Eternal at the Mercantile Temple, Morion is most often found escorting high-value trade caravans through distant trade routes. He is often accompanied by a small battalion of warforged dedicated to the mercantile clergy. Morion is quite fond of one particular follower, <a href=https://getvibrantgames.com/npc2/cure/>Cure.</a></p>
