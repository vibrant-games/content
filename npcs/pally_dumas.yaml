# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Pally Dumas is one of the three Dumas Triplets, two girls and a boy that look to be about 7 years old. The girls are identical twins and the boy also bears a remarkable resemblance. However, in reality, the Triplets are 
      not even related. Sally is a Hexblood while while Allie is a changeling who has bonded with and taken on the appearence of Sally full time, and Pally is a Nezumi rat-folk that wears an almost permanent glamour that 
      makes him resemble his "siblings". The Triplets are counted among the many mysterious "cousins" of the Dumas Family and they seem to mostly thrive on creating chaos and discord for everyone around them. They each use their
      many magical talents to torment their prey du jour. They rarely kill their victims, but prefer to leave them terrified, paranoid and sometimes delusional.

    personality: |
      Pally Dumas, unless required for a good prank, at all times looks and acts like a male version of his twin "sisters". Pally defers to his "sisters" in all thing, at least until it's time to fight, at which point he becaomes
      vicious and animalistic.
