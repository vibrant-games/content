    background-story: |
      <P>Johannes grew up in a middle class family and never really had to work hard for anything. He spent a fair amount of time in pubs and taverns as a teen and eventually just fell into working in them. </p><p>His elf side gives him a natural dexterity for flare bartending and showmanship. As handsome and skilled as he is, he's become a very popular attraction at the local bars and makes a very good living for a drink slinger.</p><p> He loves being an attraction and leans into showing off, and the ladies eat it up. He is smart enough to pay attention to what is going on around him and can be a valuable source of information if he can be briefly pulled away from his entertaining the bar crowd.</p>
