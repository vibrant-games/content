      Varun is one of very few who know that the Bakerfield family is now run by a Lich who lives across the continent using the family's resources to further his quest to become a god. Varun also knows where all of the bodies are buried (metaphorically because he has his finger on the pulse of the city, and literally because he put a lot of the bodies there.)

    special-equipment:
    - Varun's great club, "Widowmaker", is never far from his grasp. It was imbued with a strong magic that makes it easier and faster to wield by the Lich whom he secretly serves. Mechanically, it is a +3 magic weapon. Varun has had this club since he was a teenager, living on the streets of Underboot [or any slum in the major city who's criminal underworld he now runs]. He could barely wield it then.

    background-story: |
      <p>Varun Bakerfield developed his dog-eat-dog attitude growing up on the streets of Underboot [or another slum in a major city] in the shadows of the cosmopolitan city of Invasaad [or another major, advanced city.] To this day, he despises those born with a silver spoon in their mouths and the culture that they enjoy. </p><p>Supremely confident, he believes that what he lacks in book learning, he more than makes up for in raw intellect and street-smarts. Furthermore, he knows that if he can’t win an argument with words, he can settle one with his fists, or his club “Widowmaker” just as easily.</p>
      |
      As a natural leader, people have always naturally been drawn to him. It is this natural charisma combined with utter ruthlessness that allowed Varun to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld until he was ready to start his own thieves guild, the Bakerfield Family. From there, he waged a war on the other guilds, winning turf wars with violence and cunning until he and his guild were the only street level gang standing.
      |
      During his rise, to help assure victory, Varun made a deal with a Lich named Ryxiltan. In exchange for a large portion of his guild’s earnings, Ryxiltan used his magic to permanently increase Varun’s strength and leadership presence going as far as giving him the ability to bend weak-minded criminals to his will whenever he pleased.
      |
      Being the servant of a powerful Lich is no easy task. Despite his success, Varun regrets the deal he made and is looking for ways to get himself out of it.
