# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Nothuriel was a great leader of the King's Army. Rising up through the ranks along side of her beloved husband Gerrard Romkey. Their bond of love provided each other with strength and resolve. The two had waded into many
      a battle and conquored many a foe in the name their god, king and country, becoming regaled heroes of the realm. All until the last battle. Nothuriel had secretly heard dark voices in her head since childhood. Those voices
      had lead her to find and take a cursed blade called the Blood-Sword. In the pitch of battle, the Blood-Sword caused Nothuriel to lose control. Mid-battle she turned and impaled her love, the Blood-Sword absorbing his blood
      and soul preventing any magical healing from reviving him and restoring his life. Fiding that the army's healers, doctors and clerics could not restore Gerrard, she immediately walked away and went on a quest to find 
      someone or something that could. Since then she has wandered the earth, searching ancient texts and ruins and temples to find a way to bring him back. She has also sworn to find and reek vengeance against the cause of 
      the voices in her head

    personality: |
      Nothuriel is a broken and battered woman. She is depressed, exhausted and well on her way to madness. She no longer speaks, other than in mumbled and muffled tones and only to herself, her sword and the voices in her head.
      She will absolutely not be curved or distracted from her mission. She will do her best to walk away from confrontation, but if pressed will bring to bear all of her considerable martial prowess.
