  author-notes:
  - Nagata means "long rice paddy" in Japanese, though the character is a smorgasbord of cultures.
  - Nagata is definitely a THEY / THEM, not a he / him or a she / her.
  - Nevertheless, they were partly inspired by Naomi Nagata from The Expanse.

    background-story: |
      <p>Needless to say, Orcs aren't known for their navy. Yet that isn't to say that Orcs aren't sea-men. Born and raised by the Yellow Teeth tribe in the Northern Wastes of Kalauzumar [Any Remote Wasteland], Nagata was taught in swamp navigation and eventually in how to navigate the more shallow seas that surrounded the Wastelands. An ambitious young man, he dreamed of a life on the seas. But he knew this wouldn't be possible within the confines of his tribe. Although he tried his hands at engineering various war machines for his tribe and was actually quite talented at it, this couldn't possibly compare to his dreams of living a life on the high-seas. </p><p>Although he loved his people, he loved the sea more. After yet another unecessarily violent raid by his tribe on a sea-side frontier town they made there way back towards the black swamps they deemed their home. Nagata was dismayed. He took a quick look around at the crew, made a broad and clearly unsuspicious gesture towards the starboard bow of the ship and whistled clearly (a known call for his shipmates) and then made a deliberate and unnoticeable dash to the port side of the ship diving off quietly into the water.</p><p>Nagata swam to shore unnoticed and sat on his knees. He ran his fingers through the sand, muttering, "dear sea, you have me".</p>
