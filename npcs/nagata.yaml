# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Needless to say, Orcs aren't known for their navy. Yet that isn't to say that Orcs aren't sea-men. Born and raised by the Yellow Teeth tribe in the Northern Wastes of Kalauzumar [Any Remote Wasteland], Nagata was taught in
     swamp navigation and eventually in how to navigate the more shallow seas that surrounded the Wastelands. An ambitious young man, he dreamed of a life on the seas. But he knew this wouldn't be possible within the confines
     of his tribe. Although he tried his hands at engineering various war machines for his tribe and was actually quite talented at it, this couldn't possibly compare to his dreams of living a life on the high-seas.
     Although he loved his people, he loved the sea more. After yet another unecessarily violent raid by his tribe on a sea-side frontier town they made there way back towards the black swamps they deemed their home. Nagata was
     dismayed. He took a quick look around at the crew, made a broad and clearly unsuspicious gesture towards the starboard bow of the ship and whistled clearly (a known call for his shipmates) and then made a deliberate and
     unnoticeable dash to the port side of the ship diving off quietly into the water. Nagata swam to shore unnoticed and sat on his knees. He ran his fingers through the sand, muttering, "dear sea, you have me".


      
    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Nagata never really enjoyed his life in the orc clans. He was unhappy, listless and restless. He dreamed of a free life on the sea and one day made a break for it. He however, has yet to get a chance to live his dream. As
      an orc, there aren't a whole lot of captains willing to take him on. So he mostly just aimlessly wanders the shoreline trying to survive
