# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Turn Undead
    - content: As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving 
               throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. 
               It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

               percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be 
               appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, 
               no roll required.

    - content: The intricately carved broach has 1 charge that is evoked when rubbed. When evoked, the person activating the charm gains a +2 bonus to persuasion checks if the target of the persuasion is of a desired sex and 
               species. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. When the effect ends, it cannot be used again until after a Long Rest
    - title: Staff of Charming
    - content: While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 Charges to cast Charm Person, Command, or comprehend Languages from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic 
               Quarterstaff. If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that Targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff 
               again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an Enchantment spell that Targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you can use your Reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and 
               turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell. The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical 
               Quarterstaff.
    - title: Black Heart Dagger
    - content: This weapon allows you to cast Darkness nonmagically as an action, regaining use at dawn. You are not affected by this, and thus may see through it as normal. If another creature casts Darkness, or other magical 
               darkness is applied in this area, the spell affects you as normal.
               First strike - If you are in the globe of darkness created by this weapon and you have advantage on the melee attack roll, this weapon's base damage is 4d4.
    - title: Talisman of Ultimate Evil
    - content: This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good nor evil in Alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the 
               talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.
               If you are an evil Cleric or Paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy Symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell Attack rolls while you wear or hold it.
               The talisman has 6 Charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is 
               of good Alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no 
               trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.
    - title: Ring of Regeneration
    - content: While wearing this ring, you regain 1d6 Hit Points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full 
               functionality after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.

      She is also the child of a union between Anastasia'a only daughter and the family's patron Devil. She is the high priestess of the family and helps her grandmother with all of the
      family rites and ceremonies dedicated to her father. She also has several children of her own with Nicodeamus most of whom have some degree of her devil heritage. In addition to that, she
      also has her "children", a group of lesser devils and minor undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, Scarecrows, poes, etc.). She is also responsible for recruiting initiates into the family,
      training new inductees and sacrificing those that don't make the cut.

    personality: |
      Irini Dumas is a drop dead gorgeous waife of a woman. Her pale, freckled face is silhouetted by long, flowing deep red hair. Her fine features are the kind that catch the attention of men and women alike.
      Tiny horns peak out from the top of her forehead, the only visable sign of her hellish heritage. Always dressed in long, flowing, black gowns, she always looks fantastic. Her weapon of choice is seduction
      and manipulation, and she is a master of both. Her beauty doesn't hurt at all, but her persuasive abilities and her magic skills, blessed by her father, make her a dangerous package. In addition to that,
      she is a zealot, masochist and full on psychopath. However, despite al of this, in her own way she is a devoted mother to her children and to her "Children". While she does her absolute best not to do her
      fighting herself, she will absolutely wade fully into battle to defend her children.
