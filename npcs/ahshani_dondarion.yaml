    background-story: |
      <p>Ahshani came from a small but noble house from a distant continent [any with PanAsian historical flare].  He trained from a young age in the way of the samurai and according to his master was destined to be the greatest of his time. As a teen, he fell in love with a local serving girl, much below his station. Forbidden by his house to see her, he continued to sneak out to spend time with her.</p><p>One night while he was clandestinely in his lovers arms, his master was assassinated and his house was murdered. Blaming himself, Ahshani gathered his armor and his master's blade and left his home, becoming a ronin. Swearing to fight against evil wherever he finds it, all the while searching for the answers to who murdered his family their motivations for doing so.</p>
