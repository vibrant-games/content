  profile: 
    background-story: |
        Many years ago, after the murder of her wealthy husband, Anastasia made a deal with a powerful devil for the power to seek revenge on her husbands 
        killers. This deal gave her immense power in return for sending souls to the devil to feast upon. The deal has greatly extended Anastasia's life span, 
        but has not stopped her from aging. As a result, she has become a frail, withered old raisin of a woman. This has in no way diminished her powers 
        at all, on the contrary her magics are more powerful than ever. In the service of her devil master, she has built the cult known as the "Dumas Family", 
        some of which are actual blood relatives and descendants, but most of which are cultists , followers and hangers-on. Her cultists cultivate the follwers 
        and the best of them get innitiated into the family and the rest become sacrifices to their patron. The Family has developed an evergrowing following 
        and because of Anastasia's power, keen mind and ruthlessness has made deep inroads into many local institutions including guilds, noble houses, city hall, 
        the city watch and possibly even further. Because of her growing infirmity, she has predominantly become reclusive in the family home and passed all of 
        the more public duties of leadership to her grandson Nickodeamus, a cocky and vicious litlle cur. However, she still performs most of the communion and
        sacrificial rites to her patron herself. She spends more and more time in a fugue state communing with her patron and less and less time in lucidity. 
        She is capable of great feats of magic but will almost never engage in extended combat. If she can't immediately dispatch her eneies within or before the 
        first round of combat, she will summon and allow her family to do her fighting for her and use her magic to make her escape as quickly as possible. It is
        unclear what her or her patron's endgame is beyond the accumulation of power and the devouring of souls, but theres no way it's good for anyone.
    personality: |
        Anastasia was once a fairly regular woman, perhaps a little bit rude, snobby and condescending, but nothing too exceptional. Her husband's murder at the
        hands of his business rivals, left her a broken, vengeful and angry woman. Feeling helpless to get revenge on her own, she sought out ancient rites and 
        made a pact with a greater devil to give herself the powers she needed. Cold, calculating and shrewed, one by one she sent her enemies souls to her patron. 
        By the time she had exacted her revenge the kust for power had overcome her. As the years went by and she grew her family, she became more and more cruel
        vicious and wrathful. The more time she spent communing with her patron, the less of a grip she continued to hold on reality and is now quite mad. 
        Despite her madnees and her infirmity, she is still very capable, cunning and intelligent. She rules her family with an iron fist and will tolerate no
        failure from her descendants or followers. She is manuipulative, and will often play members of her family against each other to get the outcome she wants.

The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics, with the following changes - - The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast. - It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level. - It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. - At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound. The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast.
