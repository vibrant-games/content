# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - decription: You gain two of the following Metamagic Options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.
  - abilities:
    - empowered spell: When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered 
                      Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
    - heightened spell: When you Cast a Spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its Effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made 
                        against the spell.
    - subtle spell: When you Cast a Spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal Components
    - etwinned spell: When you Cast a Spell that Targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the 
                      same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip)
  - title: Sorcerous Restoration
  - description: you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a Short Rest
  - title: Shadow Magic Abilities
  - abilities:
    - eyes of the dark: you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet. When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the Darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you 
                        can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.
    - strength of the grave: When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are 
                             reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit. After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics, with the following changes
  - additional-information:
    - The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
    - It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
    - It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
    - At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.
    - The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it 
      can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has 
      disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.
  - title: Shadow walk
  - description: You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim

                 creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you 
                 die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

    background-story: |
      Many years ago, after the murder of her wealthy husband, Anastasia made a deal with a powerful devil for the power to seek revenge on her husbands 
      killers. This deal gave her immense power in return for sending souls to the devil to feast upon. The deal has greatly extended Anastasia's life span, 
      but has not stopped her from aging. As a result, she has become a frail, withered old raisin of a woman. This has in no way diminished her powers 
      at all, on the contrary her magics are more powerful than ever. In the service of her devil master, she has built the cult known as the "Dumas Family", 
      some of which are actual blood relatives and descendants, but most of which are cultists , followers and hangers-on. Her cultists cultivate the follwers 
      and the best of them get innitiated into the family and the rest become sacrifices to their patron. The Family has developed an evergrowing following 
      and because of Anastasia's power, keen mind and ruthlessness has made deep inroads into many local institutions including guilds, noble houses, city hall, 
      the city watch and possibly even further. Because of her growing infirmity, she has predominantly become reclusive in the family home and passed all of 
      the more public duties of leadership to her grandson Nickodeamus, a cocky and vicious litlle cur. However, she still performs most of the communion and
      sacrificial rites to her patron herself. She spends more and more time in a fugue state communing with her patron and less and less time in lucidity. 
      She is capable of great feats of magic but will almost never engage in extended combat. If she can't immediately dispatch her eneies within or before the 
      first round of combat, she will summon and allow her family to do her fighting for her and use her magic to make her escape as quickly as possible. It is
      unclear what her or her patron's endgame is beyond the accumulation of power and the devouring of souls, but theres no way it's good for anyone.

    personality: |
      Anastasia was once a fairly regular woman, perhaps a little bit rude, snobby and condescending, but nothing too exceptional. Her husband's murder at the
      hands of his business rivals, left her a broken, vengeful and angry woman. Feeling helpless to get revenge on her own, she sought out ancient rites and 
      made a pact with a greater devil to give herself the powers she needed. Cold, calculating and shrewed, one by one she sent her enemies souls to her patron. 
      By the time she had exacted her revenge the kust for power had overcome her. As the years went by and she grew her family, she became more and more cruel
      vicious and wrathful. The more time she spent communing with her patron, the less of a grip she continued to hold on reality and is now quite mad. 
      Despite her madnees and her infirmity, she is still very capable, cunning and intelligent. She rules her family with an iron fist and will tolerate no
      failure from her descendants or followers. She is manuipulative, and will often play members of her family against each other to get the outcome she wants.
