# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Many years ago, after the murder of her wealthy husband, Anastasia made a deal with a powerful devil for the power to seek revenge on her husbands 
      killers. This deal gave her immense power in return for sending souls to the devil to feast upon. The deal has greatly extended Anastasia's life span, 
      but has not stopped her from aging. As a result, she has become a frail, withered old raisin of a woman. This has in no way diminished her powers 
      at all, on the contrary her magics are more powerful than ever. In the service of her devil master, she has built the cult known as the "Dumas Family", 
      some of which are actual blood relatives and descendants, but most of which are cultists , followers and hangers-on. Her cultists cultivate the follwers 
      and the best of them get innitiated into the family and the rest become sacrifices to their patron. The Family has developed an evergrowing following 
      and because of Anastasia's power, keen mind and ruthlessness has made deep inroads into many local institutions including guilds, noble houses, city hall, 
      the city watch and possibly even further. Because of her growing infirmity, she has predominantly become reclusive in the family home and passed all of 
      the more public duties of leadership to her grandson Nickodeamus, a cocky and vicious litlle cur. However, she still performs most of the communion and
      sacrificial rites to her patron herself. She spends more and more time in a fugue state communing with her patron and less and less time in lucidity. 
      She is capable of great feats of magic but will almost never engage in extended combat. If she can't immediately dispatch her eneies within or before the 
      first round of combat, she will summon and allow her family to do her fighting for her and use her magic to make her escape as quickly as possible. It is
      unclear what her or her patron's endgame is beyond the accumulation of power and the devouring of souls, but theres no way it's good for anyone.

    personality: |
      Anastasia was once a fairly regular woman, perhaps a little bit rude, snobby and condescending, but nothing too exceptional. Her husband's murder at the
      hands of his business rivals, left her a broken, vengeful and angry woman. Feeling helpless to get revenge on her own, she sought out ancient rites and 
      made a pact with a greater devil to give herself the powers she needed. Cold, calculating and shrewed, one by one she sent her enemies souls to her patron. 
      By the time she had exacted her revenge the kust for power had overcome her. As the years went by and she grew her family, she became more and more cruel
      vicious and wrathful. The more time she spent communing with her patron, the less of a grip she continued to hold on reality and is now quite mad. 
      Despite her madnees and her infirmity, she is still very capable, cunning and intelligent. She rules her family with an iron fist and will tolerate no
      failure from her descendants or followers. She is manuipulative, and will often play members of her family against each other to get the outcome she wants.
