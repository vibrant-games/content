   - - Psi Knight Abilities:
         - Psionic Talents: You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of 
                            which is a d6.
                            - Psionic Talent Options: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways - 
                              - Protective Field: When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to roll your Psionic Talent die and reduce the damage taken by the number 
                                                  rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.
                              - Psi-Powered Leap: When you make a high or long jump, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and extend the distance of the jump, up to a number of feet equal to twice the number rolled plus twice 
                                                  your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 extra foot). This extra distance costs you only 1 foot of movement.
                              - Telekinetic Strike: You can propel your attacks with telekinetic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you deal damage to a target within 30 feet of you with a weapon  attack, you 
                                                    can roll your Psionic Talent die and also deal force damage to the target equal to the number rolled.
                            - Changing the Die’s Size: If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example,
                                                       if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic
                                                       Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4,
                                                       the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting 
                                                       size of your Psionic Talent die increases - at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
                            - Psi Replenishment: As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long
                                                 rest.
         - Telekinetic Adept: You have mastered new ways to use your telekinesis - 
                            - Psionic Thrust: When you deal damage to a target with the Telekinetic Strike of your Psionic Talent, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your 
                                              proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Unless the save succeeds, you can knock the target prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.
                            - Telekinetic Movement: If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can move an object or a creature with your mind. As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing 
                                                    creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it
                                                    is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both. When you take this action, your Psionic Talent die 
                                                    decreases by one die size.
         - Psi-Enhanced Metabolism: The psionic energy flowing through you has bolstered your mind and body. You have resistance to poison and psychic damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.
         - Bulwark of Force: You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures 
                             equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t
                             do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you decrease your Psionic Talent die by one die size to use this feature again.
         - Telekinetic Master: Your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by few. If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can cast the telekinesis spell, requiring no components. Your spellcasting 
                               ability for the spell is Intelligence. When you cast this spell, your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size
                               
                               
   - - Samurai Abilities:
       - Fighting Spirit: your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on all weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you 
                          do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level. You can use this feature
                          three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
       - Elegant Courtier: your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier. Your self-
                           control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
       - Tireless Spirit: when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.
       - Rapid Strike: you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll 
                       to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.
       - Strength Before Death: your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an 
                                extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra
                                turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 
                                
                                
                                
   - - Arcane Archer Abilities:
       - Arcane Archer Lore: you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature – typical for practitioners of of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and 
                             you choose to learn either the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip.
       - Arcane Shot: you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below). Once per turn when you 
                      fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn’t
                      involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you 
                      reach certain levels in this class; 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.
                       - Arcane Shot Options: If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
                         - Banishing Arrow: You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or 
                                            be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied
                                            space if that space is occupied. After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.
                         - Beguiling Arrow: Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 
                                            feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally 
                                            attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
                         - Bursting Arrow: You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The arrow detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other
                                           creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each. The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
                         - Enfeebling Arrow: You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the 
                                             damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn. The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
                         - Grasping Arrow: When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage,
                                           its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it 
                                           can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this 
                                           option again. The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
                         - Piercing Arrow: You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, 
                                           which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
                                           On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. The piercing 
                                           damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
                         - Seeking Arrow: Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you 
                                          don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and 
                                          ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a 
                                          Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful 
                                          save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location. The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
                         - Shadow Arrow: You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a 
                                         Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
       - Magic Arrow: you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
                      attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.
       - Curving Shot: you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within
                       60 feet of the original target.
       - Ever-Ready Shot: your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.



   - - Battle Master Abilities:
       - Combat Superiority:
         - Maneuvers: You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th 
                      level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one
         - Superiority Dice: You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another 
                             superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.
         - Maneuver DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
       - Student of War: you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice
       - Know Your Enemy: if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the 
                          creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice; Strength score, Dexterity score, Constitution score, Armor Class, Current hit points, 
                          Total class levels, if any, Fighter class levels, if any
       - Improves Superiority: your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.
       - Relentless: when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die    



   - - Echo Knight Abilities:
       - Manifest Echo: you can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it 
                        is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you're incapacitated. Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all 
                        conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to 
                        move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.
                        - As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you
                        - When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo's space. You make this choice for each attack
                        - When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the 
                          echo's space
       - Unleash Incarnation: Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo's position. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum 
                              of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Echo Avatar:  As an action, you can see through your echo's eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are deafened and blinded. You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any 
                       time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.
       - Shadow Martyr: you can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied 
                        space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or 
                        long rest.
       - Reclaim Potential: you've learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier,
                            provided you don't already have temporary hit points. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a
                            long rest.
       - Legion of One: you can use a bonus action to create two echos with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can co-exist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do
                        from one echo's position can be done from the other's instead. In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.
