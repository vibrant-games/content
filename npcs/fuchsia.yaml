    background-story: |
      <p> The royals of Avonguard Vale [a Forest Gnome City] have difficulty tracing their lineage because of infidelity of the High Tinker Yahnigan Buuhl. His lecherous infidelity has diffused his line many, many times. Among this brood, one stands apart because of her combination of madness and beauty - Fuchsia.</p><p>She is well aware of her royal lineage but has been denounced from announcing it. Yet she couldn't care less and often flaunts it in the presence of just about anyone who will listen, claiming that her mother, a barmaid named Clarice, is the Low Queen of the Region. She weaves stories about her life as the Low Queen's daughter at local taverns and mercantile houses, gaining quite an audience who are more than happy to pay for her discursive talent.</p>
