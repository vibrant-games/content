    background-story: |
       <p>The great battles of the Duplicity [any significant historical war] witnessed the warring of races over the sovereignty of nations. While the elves and humans were on tenuous grounds with regards to alliances and the mixing of races largely frowned upon, the increasing lack of militia led to ranked officers looking the other way when enlisting half-broods. The Sylvan elves, each tribe aligned with different unique aspects of their natural environment, drew from various natural forces. Katerina's tribe allied with Treants and their ilk. Raised by Druids of the circle of Selune [or a similar moon God/dess], her tribe stood fanatically against the forces sweeping across the wildlands.</p><p>Katerina enlisted in the army of allied humans and elves and fought valiantly in the long war. When various treaties were eventually reached and a modicum of peace blanketed the region, her people were less isolated and had folded themselves into the broader cultures of the region. Her experiences in the war sill resonated and her distaste for other races lingered.</p><p> Still heavily traumatized, her psyche remains conflicted between the traditions deeply embedded into her being and the desire to achieve her own imagined goals of establishing a Sylvan Kingdom that celebrates the trees and creations of nature. while abandoning the tinkering with technologies and dark magicks.</p>
