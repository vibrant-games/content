# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Natural Explorer 
    - content: Favored Terrain - You can choose one type of terrain; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you are proficient.
    - content: While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits - 
    - content: Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
    - content: Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
    - content: Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
    - content: If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
    - content: When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
    - content: While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area
    - title: Spirit Sight
    - content: You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see,
               such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated
    - title: Primal Protector
    - content: You can connect with animal spirits and improve the demeanor of a creature with the beast type that you can see. Using your totem, you can use your action to attempt to make a target creature
               indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. Each beast creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
               it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate. You are able to perform this twice per short or long rest
    - title: Spiritual Connection
    - content: Your spiritual connection with your Spirit World grows and it blesses you with mental fortitude. A spiritual aura surrounds you, and grants you and any allies within 10 feet advantage on
               Constitution and Wisdom saving throws 
    - title: Bounty of Life
    - content: You can choose to drain the life force from a creature. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw versus your spell save DC; on a failed save, you
               gain temporary hit points equal to the damage caused to the creature. You can use this ability once per round
    - title: Spiritual Whisper
    - contnet: You are bestowed a magical secret as if it were a whisper into your mind. Choose one 6th- level spell from the Druid spell list as this whisper. You can cast your secret spell once without expending a
               spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more druid spells of your choice that can be cast in this way; one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level
               spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Spiritual whisper when you finish a long rest. 
    - title: Eternal Favor

    - title: Spiritual Warrior
    - content: You embody the spiritual power of the world and it infuses you with vigor and insight. Your Wisdom score increases by 4. Your maximum for this score is now 24 
               
  - title: Calling of the Spirit Abilities
  - abilities:
    - title: Spiritual Guide
    - content: You are bestowed a spirit guide to help you progress further. The spirit guide takes on the incorporeal form of your totem spirit. Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your Spirit Guide
               appears by your side. The Spirit Guide is the embodiment of the Spirit World for you. It cannot be seen by anyone else by non-magical means, but it can see and hear others as you would. The Spirit
               guide communicates and interacts with the shaman as a conscious being. The spirit guide grants the shaman advantage to initiative rolls, can’t be surprised while conscious, and other creatures don’t
               gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.
    - title: Ghost Touch
    - content: Any weapon that you touch deals damage normally against any incorporeal creature regardless of its resistance to that damage type. This feature lasts as long as the shaman holds the weapon. The shaman also
               gains resistance to melee attacks from incorporeal creatures e.g. ghosts, shadows, wraiths, will-o’-wisp, specters
    - title: Spiritual Focus
    - content: You can give the spirit guide the task of concentrating on a spell or spell-like ability that is maintained through concentration. The shaman can act normally while his spirit guide concentrates on the
               spell. If the shaman casts another spell that requires concentration, then the first spell effect ends and the second spell begins. The shaman can choose the spirit guide to concentrate on any
               subsequent spells cast. A spirit guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. A spirit guide does not have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such as the shaman taking damage. The
               spirit guide is not present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact. If the shaman falls unconscious or dies, then the spirit guide stops concentrating on the spell, and the spell’s effect ends.
    - title: Spirit Journey
    - content: A spirit shaman knows how to vanish bodily into the Spirit World. As an Action, a shaman can become incorporeal and move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes
               1d10 force damage if he ends his turn inside an object. While incorporeal, the shaman does not invoke attacks of opportunity. Outside of combat, the shaman can spend time in prayer and meditation to
               commune directly with other spirits in the Spirit World to attempt receive information concerning their current quest. The shaman can ask three questions that can be answers with a yes or no. While in
               meditation, the shaman’s soul is in the Spirit World, and cannot communicate with others in the Natural world

  - title: Attacks
  - content: Knife or Spell
  - title: Combat Tactics
  - content: He will hit and run if she needs to martial attack, mostly trying to cause mischief and small wound. 

  - title: Special Equipment
  - abilities:
    - title: Crown of Madness 
    - content: A light-weight, blackened, metal circlet of a crown. Once attuned, the crown allows its wearer to cast the following spells once per day with a spell DC of 15: 
    - content: Crown of Madness, Puppet, Charm Person, Friends, Hideous Laughter, Irresistable Dance, Fear and Vicious Mockery 
    - title: Void Knife
    - content: This dagger’s blade is composed of black, bone-like material. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. If you are in dim light or darkness, you regain a 
               number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt to the target.
    - content: Wounds from this blade never truly heal and leave behind a deep black scar where the target was struck. If more than 30HP damage is cause by the Void Knife, the scar causes constant throbbing pain and gives the 
               recipient disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks until cured. The scar fades if the blade is destroyed. Alternatively, the scar can be cured with a Lesser Restoration or Remove Curse spell.
    - title: Ring of Evasion
    - content: This ring has 3 Charges, and it regains 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your Reaction to expend 1 of its Charges to succeed on that saving 
               throw instead.
    - title: Ring of Alteration
    - content: While wearing this ring, the wearer is permanently under the effects of an Alter Self spell allowing the wearer to take on any appearance for as long as they are wearing the ring.

    background-story: |
      Pally Dumas is one of the three Dumas Triplets, two girls and a boy that look to be about 7 years old. The girls are identical twins and the boy also bears a remarkable resemblance. However, in reality, the Triplets are 
      not even related. Sally is a Hexblood while while Allie is a changeling who has bonded with and taken on the appearence of Sally full time, and Pally is a Nezumi rat-folk that wears an almost permanent glamour that 
      makes him resemble his "siblings". The Triplets are counted among the many mysterious "cousins" of the Dumas Family and they seem to mostly thrive on creating chaos and discord for everyone around them. They each use their
      many magical talents to torment their prey du jour. They rarely kill their victims, but prefer to leave them terrified, paranoid and sometimes delusional.

      Pally Dumas, unless required for a good prank, at all times looks and acts like a male version of his twin "sisters". Pally defers to his "sisters" in all thing, at least until it's time to fight, at which point he becaomes
      vicious and animalistic.
