# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  - title: Soulknife Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Psionic Talent
    - content: You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of 
               which is a d6.
    - title: Psionic Talent Options
    - content: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways -
    - content: Psi-Bolstered Knack - When your non-psionic training fails you, you can tap into your psionic power to help; if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you 
                                     can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success.
    - content: Psychic Whispers - You can use your psychic abilities to establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, you give yourself and at least one
                                  other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal
                                  to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action 
                                  required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can’t use this telepathy if it can’t speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic
                                  connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don’t need to speak a common language to understand each other.
    - content: Changing the Die’s Size - If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example,
                                         if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your 
                                         Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you 
                                         roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this 
                                         class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases - at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
    - content: Psi Replenishment - As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Psychic Blades
    - content: You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. When you are about to make a melee or ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free 
               hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals 
               psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals 
               damage. After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The 
               damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.
    - title: Psionic Enhancement
    - content: You can focus your psionic power to give yourself an extraordinary ability. When you finish a long rest, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until you finish a long rest 
               You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If a creature can speak at least one language, it can respond to you telepathically.
               Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.
               Your hit point maximum and your current hit points increase by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your rogue level.
    - title: Soul Blades
    - content: Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you finer control over them in the following ways - 
    - content: Homing Strikes - If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, 
                                your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size, regardless of the number rolled.
    - content: Psychic Teleportation - If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can hurl your Psychic Blades to magically transport yourself to another location. As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic
                                       Blades and throw it at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 5 times the highest number on your Psionic Talent die. You then teleport to that space,
                                       the blade vanishes, and your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size.
    - content: Terrifying Blade - When you damage a creature with your Psychic Blade, you can force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). On a 
                                  failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature isn’t frightened and is immune to your Terrifying Blade for 24 hours.
    - title: Psionic Veil
    - content: You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 10 minutes or until you dismiss this effect 
               (no action required). This invisibility ends if you deal damage to a creature or if you force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long 
               rest, unless you decrease your Psionic Talent die by one die size to use this feature again.
               
  - title: Assassin Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Bonus Proficiencies
    - content: When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.
    - title: Assassinate
    - content: You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a 
               creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

    - content: When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
    - title: Magical Guidance
    - content: When you reach 5th level, you can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try and conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and 
               you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success
               
  - title: Psionic Soul Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Psionic Talent
    - content: You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of 
               which is a d6.
    - title: Psionic Talent Options
    - content: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways -
    - content: Psionic Discovery - You can unlock the ability to cast a mind-oriented sorcerer spell you don’t already know. After meditating for 10 minutes (which can be done during a rest), roll your Psionic 
                                   Talent die, and choose a sorcerer spell of a level for which you have spell slots and that is in the school of divination or enchantment. You know the chosen spell for a number of 
                                   hours equal to the number you rolled.
    - content: Psychic Sorcery - When you cast a spell, you can use your mind to form it, rather than relying on words, gestures, and materials. To do so, roll your Psionic Talent die. The spell then requires no 
                                 verbal component, and if you rolled the level of the spell or higher, the spell doesn’t require somatic or material components either
    - content: Telepathic Speech - You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see, and roll your Psionic Talent die. For a number
                            of hours equal to the number you rolled, you and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other 
                            equal to the number you rolled. To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows. The telepathic connection ends early if you use this ability
                            to form a connection with a different creature.
    - content: Changing the Die’s Size - If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example,
                                         if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your 
                                         Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you 
                                         roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this 
                                         class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases - at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
    - content: Psi Replenishment - As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Psychic Strike
    - content: You have learned to channel additional psychic energy into your spells. Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with a sorcerer spell for which you expend a spell slot, you can roll your Psionic 
               Talent die and also deal psychic damage to that creature equal to the number rolled. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

  - title: Attacks
  - content: Knives and spells
  - title: Combat Tactics
  - content: Will as often as possible attack from stealth 

  - title: Special Equipment
  - abilities:
    - title: Wand of Paralysis
    - content: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must
               succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
    - content: The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
    - title: Bag of Devouring
    - content: This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
    - content: The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is 
               placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a 
               successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). 
               Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.
    - content: Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM 
               determines the time and plane.
    - content: If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
    - title: Ring of Evasion
    - content: This ring has 3 Charges, and it regains 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your Reaction to expend 1 of its Charges to succeed on that saving 
               throw instead.
    - title: Ring of Spell Turning
    - content: While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the 
               spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster. 
    - title: Boots of Speed
    - content: While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has 
               disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.
    - content: When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.

    background-story: |
      Beuford Dumas is one of the more prominent and revered of the Dumas family's seemingly endless pool of "cousins". Like most of the "cousins", no one in nor outside of the family (excepy maybe the family patron)
      really seems to know what their lineage nor their parentage are, but they are a cousin all the same. Based on their lack of humanoid form, its largely assumed that Beuford comes from somewhere on Mordecai's changeling
      side of the family, but really, who knows.

    personality: |
      Beuford Dumas is a being of stealth and skill, using their ooze-based body to sneak and hide and strike from the shadows. They speak very little and when they do, only via telepathy, and only to their superiors in the 
      family. They cannot be frightened or intimidated and basically function as a weapon for their family members. Once pointed at a target, they will just keep trying to kill it until the target is dead, they're dead or the 
      kill order is recinded by a family member. One could be forgiven for thinking Beuford was a mindless killing machine, but they are actually quite intelligent and very very cunning, as they demostrate with the creativity 
      and joy they display in their kills.
