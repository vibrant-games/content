# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Milne Bloody-Tooth is the adult son of the war leader of the Bearkin Nation. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Milne is a massive Bearkin, even larger than his father. Though he was still just a teen when their
      tribe was wiped out by Grey Crow, he swore an oath to get vengeance for the deaths of his mother and the rest of the tribe. Since that day, he has ever been the good soldier, devoting his life to honing his craft and
      preparing for what he believes will be his and the entire Bearkin Nation's final battle. Only then will he be able to know peace.

     Milne Bloody-Tooth is a giant, even for a Bearkin. In his brass dragon scale armor, he looks like a golden, gleaming wall. Milne is quiet, reserved and studious when he is not in battle, He mostly keeps to himself
     and focuses on perfecting his craft. In contrast, when he steps onto a battlefield at the head of his troops, he is a champion, a ferocious combatant and a bulwark for his people. He knows that it is his destiny to 
     sacrifice himself to win the final battle, and will do so without hesitation as long as he gets vengeance for his people.
