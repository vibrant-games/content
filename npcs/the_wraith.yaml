# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

       - Expertise: Double proficiency bonus with Thieve's Tools and Sleight of Hand
       - Sneak Attack: Once per turn can add 3d6 to one creature she hits with a ranged or finesse attack if she has advantage on the attack or if the target is engaged with another creater
       - Cunning Action: Can tak a bonus action on each turn to Hide, Disengage or Dash
       - Uncanny Dodge: When an attacker she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her Reaction to halve the damage 
       - Evasion: When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail
       - Reliable Talent: Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your Proficiency Bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
       - Blindsense: if you are able to hear, you are aware of the Location of any hidden or Invisible creature within 10 feet of you
       - Slippery Mind: You gain proficiency in Wisdom Saving Throws
       - Elusive: No Attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't Incapacitated

    - Assassin Abilities:
       - Assassinate: You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
       - Infiltration Expertise: you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an
                                 identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official- looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a
                                 trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you
                                 to be that person until given an obvious reason not to
       - Imposter: you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech,
                   examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you
                   make to avoid detection.
       - Death Strike: When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack

      Her curse is actually a spell put on her by a spymaster of the assassins guild at the same time that he murdered her tribe and created her split personality. When her skills are needed a simple
      subliminal phrase brings out the Wraith, the realms deadliest assassin, she has no recollection of ever being anyone else, especially not at small, lonely, street urchin.

    personality: |
      The Wraith is a stone cold kiiler. She lives to kill. She is a loaded gun and kills whoever her master points her at. She has no real will of her own and just kills who she is told to kill. and she is very very good at it.
      She is tough, vicious and relentless. She will never give up on a target
