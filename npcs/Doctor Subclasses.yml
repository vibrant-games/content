                            total. You can instead choose to end the effects of a poison or disease affecting the target. This expends one hit die.

                                            spell through the organ once, taking the spell's normal casting time. A wizard can also dissect the organ to transcribe that spell into their spellbook, as if it were a spell scroll.

                           can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Your attacks are precise and subtle. Whenever you kill a creature, you can do so in a way that makes it seem like they died of natural causes.
                           Using your Grim Salvage ability on the creature negates this effect.

                       condition afflicting the creature. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned. Alternatively, you can end one effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum.

                         reviewing this information in order to maintain these benefits. This effect ends if you study a different creature.
