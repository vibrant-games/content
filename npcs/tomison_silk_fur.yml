# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - content: The enchantment of the toxic scabbard and any weapon sheathed in it or poison contained within it cannot be detected with divinatory magic like detect magic or detect poison unless the caster succeeds on a DC 20 
               Arcana check. As an action, the wearer can coat a weapon sheathed in the toxic scabbard with the stored poison; he has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when doing so. In addition, the wielder may 
               choose to spread the dose of the poison out by not applying a full dose, allowing him to poison his weapon more than once. He must make this choice when triggering the stored poison for the first time.

    background-story: |
      Tomison Silk-Fur primarily grew up in the big city. He was adopted at a young age by a wealthy elvish family, that treated him as sort of novelty at high society events. He was a quick study and rapidly learned the
      ins and outs of high society and diplomacy. It was not long before he started gathering and brokering information for his own purposes. In his early teens he found his way into the local thieve's guild and took to
      the profession like a fish to water. He learned all kinds of knife skills, tinkering, alchemy (mostly leaning towards poison) and espionage skills. After several years with the thieve's guild, all the while hiding
      his extracurricular from his adopted family, he heard word that his people, The Bearkin, were starting to band together under a mysterious shaman named Ursin Storm-for-Eyes. He dicided that a new nation might be in 
      need of the kind of services he could offer. Without giving notice to either his family nor his guild, he packed his knives and his newly-built gadget box and left the city to join his fellow bearkin in their new
      Bearkin Nation. Tomison was welcomed with open arms as Ursin had visions of his arrival. Tomison was quickly appointed the lead diplomat and intelligence agent for the nation and is primarily responsible for any 
      interaction between the emerging Bearkin Nation and any other local governments or other organizations.

    personality: |
     Tomison Silk-Fur is on the smaller side for a bearkin. He is primarily covered in black fur with a large white tuft of hair in the shape of a sunburst on his chest and a small white patch on his nose. He is a bit of a 
     dandy and wears exceedingly well tailored black leathers, a dagger belt across his chest, and a funny little bowler hat on is head that hes constantly fidgetting with. At all times he carries a briefcase (his gadget box)
     slung with a strap over his shoulder. Tomison is an incredibly charming, engaging and gegarious fellow. He spins a great story and easily captivates the toughest of crowds. If he wants you to like him, you definitely will.
     if he doesn't, you're probably pretty close to death. His years of wealth and privilege have left him with a strong inclination towards gambling, fine women and fine drinks. Hes been known to let his passion get the 
     better of him, but he also knows this and tends to play up his weaknesses for his benefit.
