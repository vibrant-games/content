    background-story: |
      Warsoc's father leads a powerful and especially brutal war party of orcs. With little stomach for the violence of his clan, he abandoned a raiding party in his young teens and made his way to town. He found that his tribe had lied and he wasn't immediately hated and feared for his heritage, In return, he decided he would defend his new home. When he came of age, he joined The Watch. He's a rookie and not very confident in his skills, smarts or anything else really, but his trainer and sergeant think he's slowly becoming a good watchman. He is loyal and earnest but not very assertive for an officer, but he's working on it. Since he was part of a war-band for most of his youth, he has developed an affinity for the children's toys he was denied as a child and has amassed quite a collection in his small barracks room
