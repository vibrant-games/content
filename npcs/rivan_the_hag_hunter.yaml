# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills:       
   - - Hexblood Abilities:
       - Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.
       - Fey Resilience: You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.
       - Hex Magic: You can cast the Disguise Self and Hex spells with this trait. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you gain this lineage). Once you cast either of these
                    spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spells slots you have.
       - Magic Token: As an action, you can harmlessly pull out one of your nails, a tooth, or a lock of hair. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can use an
                      action to send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are on the same plane of existence and are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five
                      words. In addition, while you are within 10 miles of the token, you can use an action to enter a trance for 1 minute, during which you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is.
                      While you are using your senses at the token’s location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. Afterward, the token is harmlessly destroyed. Once you create a token using this
                      feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows 

   - - Blood Hunter Abilities:
       - Hunters Bane: You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, as well as on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them. The Hunter’s Bane also empowers your body to 
                       control and shape hemocraft magic, using your own blood and life essence to fuel your abilities. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. 
                       - Hemocraft Save: DC 14
       - Blood Maledict: you gain the ability to channel, and sometimes sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate creatures through hemocraft magic. You gain one Blood Curse of your choice. You learn one 
                         additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. When you use your Blood Maledict, 
                         you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by losing a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft 
                         die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are 
                         immune to blood curses, unless you have amplified the curse. You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Blood Maledict feature twice, at 13th level you can use it three times 
                         between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
                         Hemocraft Die: 1d6
                         Blood Curses Known: 2
                         Blood Curses: Blood Curse of the Eyeless, Blood Curse of The Fallen Puppet
       - Figthing Style: Two Weapon Fighting
       - Crimson Rite: you learn to invoke a rite of hemocraft within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose one rite from the Primal Rites list to learn. As a bonus action, you activate a crimson rite on a 
                       single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite,
                       you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage 
                       of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active 
                       rite at a time. You learn an additional Primal Rite of your choice at 7th level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14th level.
                       Primal Rites Known: Rite of the Storm, Rite of the Flame
       - Extra Attack: you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
       - Brand of Castigation: whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded 
                               creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier 
                               (minimum of 1 damage). Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to 
                               half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

   - - Order of the Profane Soul Abilities:
       - Otherworldly Patron: Hexblade
       - Pact Magic: Spell Slots = 2
                     Spell DC = 14
                     Cantrips: Toll The Dead, Eldritch Blast 
                     Spells: Hex, Crown of Madness, Mind Thrust, Misty Step
       - Rite Focus: The Hexblade - Whenever you target a creature with a blood curse, your next attack against the cursed creature deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier
       - Mystic Frenzy: when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
       - Revealed Arcana: The Hexblade - You can cast Branding Smite once using a pact magic spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest

    special-equipment:
    - Dual Cold Iron Scimitars: will cause an extra 1d4 damage to fey, undead, and fiends it it hits them. It also counts as a magic weapon against these creatures for purposes of immunity and resistance. Due to the expense,
                                cold iron is often applied as a wire (made by pulling or swaging) and then inlayed into the weapon, rather than making the whole weapon of the metal

    background-story: |
     Rivan's parents were cursed by a hag while his mother was pregnant with him and he was born a Hexblood, part human, part Fey.  Because of his curse, he grew up as an outcast with his family traveling from town to town.
     When he turned 16 he was approached by the hag that cursed his parents who invited him to join her to be converted to a full Fey Hag. He refused and escaped. At that point he left his family and began finding ways to fight
     against his curse. Trying holy marks and sorcery, he finally stumbled across a cult of blood hunters who taught him their ways. He has been hunting Hags ever since, knowing that one day, if he doesn't destroy them all
     (which just isn't possible), he will become what he hates.

    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Rivan is quiet and calculating. He watches and waits for the most opportune time to attack while he hunts. He is haunted by what he is and hates his Fey heritage. He has sworn to destroy all Hags in a desperate effort to
     prevent the fate that he dreads. He really just wants to be a normal person and live a normal life, a wish that can never be.
