# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Gerhardt Klippstein is a brilliant and driven artificer and armorer. He had worked in the past throughout his career with Oswald Vardklemp on developing the propulsion engine for his patented Steam Wagon. 
      So when he was approached by Oswald with an offer of unlimited funding, people to work with and a compound to continue his work, he jumped at the chance. Working with the Collegium Imaginata has been a 
      dream come true for him. As an efficient researcher and administrator, Gerhardt was an easy choice for Oswald to make his second in command. Gerhardt likes Oswald, but has always believed that he is the 
      smarter of the two men and that he should be in charge of the Collegium

    personality: |
      Gerhardt Klippstein is a tall, thin, light blue-skinned, four-armed Vedalken man. He stands at about 6'6" tall. He is comepletely hairless with a broad, flat nose and light violet eyes. He is cold, severe 
      and intense. He is deeply devoted to arcane science and to his work. He firmly believes that the world should be orderly and efficient and that his work will help it become that way. He does not particularly 
      like people and rarely gets along with others but does appreciate scientific and arcane input from reputable sources. In typically dispassionate and detached Vedalken manner, he views the world through a 
      sterile lens and does his best strive for what he views as perfections and limitless efficiency.
