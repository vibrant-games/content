# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Orica Zarkova grew up in a tribe of Ondonti Orcs. Growing up with a belief in the balance of nature, celebrating strengh, survival, family and peace. She was taught healing magic early in life and has continued to 
      pursue that into her career. She has become adept at alchemy especially the creation of healing potions, but through her research has learned to make pretty much any kind of potion, oil, acid or poison. The ultimate 
      goal of her research is to develop what she calls The Elixir of Life; a potion that will both grant immortality as well as restore life to the dead and the undead. So far she has been unsuccessful in her pursuit, 
      but continues her research undetered.

    # Required.

    #
    personality: |
      Orica Zarkova Is a tall, lithe, subtly muscled, gray-skinned orc. She clearly puts considerable effort into maintaining her appearance with long, silky broan hair, pierced, pointed ears and has had her tusks filed 
      down as to not be so prevalent. She dresses in soft stylish leather armor covered by a long lab coat. Having been away from her tribe for a long time Orica is well aware of the way that the world views her people
      and because of this she has become jaded and guarded in her interations with others. She is fierce and driven to accomplish her goal. Anyone who questions her intent or ability is met with hostility and indignance. 
      She jealously guards her research and while she enjoys the benefits that the Collegium has to offer, she fears that Oswald Vardklemp and Gerhardt Klippstein want to steal her work (they don't).
