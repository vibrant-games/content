# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Ferdinand Von Lefthoff knows that flying is the best, safest and fastest way to travel. Having his own wings, he knows this from experience. As such, he has devoted his life to creating reliable commercial air transport. 
      Realizing both the potential for financial gain and the advancement of science and society, Oswald Vardklemp invited Ferdinand to join the Collegium Imginata, offering him the resources to develop his airship. He grew up 
      in the Feywild, but was exiled due to his rabid pusuit of science and technology. Ferdinand has gone through several iterations and designs for airship, but has yet to get a functioning prototype working that is capable 
      of transporting more than a couple people at a time. He firmly believes hes close to a brektrhough though.

    #
    personality: |
      Ferdinand Von Lefthoff is about 7' tall and covered in gray and white feathers, with owl-like features, beak, talons and bright, alert eyes. He is highly eccentric and dresses to match his personality. He dresses in a 
      manner of a vintage British Naval Officer with a scarlet jacket with brass buttons and epilettes, a bicorn admirals hat complete with a peacock like feather and a monocle. He is quite the character, bold, exhuberant, 
      cunning, and anyone can tell that if he ever gets his ship off the ground he will be a daring swashbuckler. In the meantime, he is also a dilligent and careful scientist in the pursuit of his goal.
