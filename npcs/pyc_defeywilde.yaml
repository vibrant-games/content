    background-story: |
      <p>The racial mixing between Elves and Humans is no mystery. The two races, each believing themselves the noblest in the realms, inevitably settled in the same regions and would inter-marry. The DeFeywilde family are an example of how the nobles of each racial lineage sought to establish a peaceful and lasting bond through the creation of a mutually beneficial political and racial ideology that served the best interests of both humans and elves.</p><p>Pyc has cultivated this lineage and pursued the proliferation of peace throughout the realm. She has been taught that nobility is not a birthright, but something established through action and self-presentation. Her clan would labor over textiles and fabrics to develop a standard of regal dress that they believed ought to be held by all members of the kingdoms. She doesn't frown on those who aren't well-kempt, nor does she sympathize. Rather, she genuinely empathizes with those who have resigned themselves to the 'less finer' things in life and advocates for the vital role that one's self-presentation takes in daily activities and overall destiny.</p>
