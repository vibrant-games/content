# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Turn Undead
    - content: As an action, you present your holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving 
               throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. 
               It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

    - content: You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your
               proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add
               the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
               proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Channel Divinity - Balm of Peace
    - content: You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any
               other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once
               whenever you take this action. 
    - title: Protective Bond
    - content: The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first
               can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

    background-story: |
     The racial mixing between Elves and Humans is no mystery. The two races, each believing themselves the noblest in the realms, inevitably settled in the same regions and would inter-marry. The DeFeywilde family are an
     example of how the nobles of each racial lineage sought to establish a peaceful and lasting bond through the creation of a mutually beneficial political and racial ideology that served the best interests of both humans and
     elves. Pyc has cultivated this lineage and pursued the proliferation of peace throughout the realm. She has been taught that nobility is not a birthright, but something established through action and self-presentation. Her
     clan would labor over textiles and fabrics to develop a standard of regal dress that they believed ought to be held by all members of the kingdoms. She doesn't frown on those who aren't well-kempt, nor does she sympathize.
     Rather, she genuinely empathizes with those who have resigned themselves to the 'less finer' things in life and advocates for the vital role that one's self-presentation takes in daily activities and overall destiny.

    #
    personality: |
     Pyc is a generous and empathetic young lady who believes in the persuit of peace and understanding. As a travelling merchant, she moves from town to town selling her fabrics and preaching peace.
