    background-story: |
      Lasan is the son of a merchant who did the same thing he does today. Make items that work for a short period of time, sell them for more than their worth, and get out of dodge before any one is the wiser.  His dad died not too long ago, and he's still trying to cope with it. He took up adventuring for a time, but it complicated him with too many attachments, he just wasn't ready for.
