# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

   - - Rogue Abilities:

   - - Mastermind Abilities:
       - Master of Intrigue: you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice
       - Master of Tactics: you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than
                            5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.
       - Insightful Manipulator:  if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if
                                  the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice;
                                  - Intelligence score
                                  - Wisdom score

       - Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Athletics, Persuasion, Intimidation, Thieves' Tools, Disguise Kit, Forgery Kit, Three-Dragon Ante Set
       - Feats: Actor, Skulker 
       
    attacks: |
      2 attacks with dagger
    combat-tactics: |
      Leo is no coward. He will, however, try to avoid or escape combat because of his belief that his worth as leader of the Lythiad assembly is more important than proving his mettle in a single battle.
    special-equipment:
    - Broken Pocket Watch: It’s rare to find a pocket watch at all outside of gnomish settlements. This one seems to be broken as it sometimes skips back a few seconds. It holds great power for the one who attunes it though.
                           The broken pocket watch has 3 charges. On your turn you can spend 1 charge to take an additional bonus action as the pocket watch ticks back by two seconds to give you another moment for something
                           quick. The pocket watch regains 1 expended charge at dawn Alternately you can force it to turn backward as far as it can go. This does not require an action and takes 3 charges. You can’t do this if
                           you are incapacitated. You teleport to any location you have been earlier in this turn you regain any hit points you have lost since the beginning of your turn and you can immediately take another
                           turn. The pocket watch falls apart after that and require 1 week of specialized repairs. If this last ability is chosen after 1 minute you suffer one level of exhaustion.
    - Dagger of Warning: - Most rogues shouldn't really need help with their perception but this dagger helps both the rogue and everyone around them. While attuned the rogue can't be surprised and are magically awoken from
                           their sleep when danger approaches, along with all allies within 30 feet of them. Not to mention the dagger gives the rogue advantage on initiative rolls which is a valuable thing for them to have.

    background-story: |
      The Lion's Mane Tavern is a charming local destination location. Well-kept with superb staff, it has a firm grip on the business of the community and its proprietor, Leo, has their respect. Leo's tavern is more than
      a reputable destination location, it is also the center for his organized crime syndicate, the Lythiad Assembly. Composed primarily of Leo's extended family but including myriad community officials and mercants, the
      Assembly doesn't perform what Leo calls, 'Brutish Outlaw' work, but instead is highly surgical in their activities. Kidnapping, smuggling, and political terrorism are the Assembly's professional province. Leo and
      his two brothers and one sister are carrying on the business of their father and uncles. Just how long the Assembly has been operating remains lore lost in history. Leo claims they've operated for centuries and span
      well-beyond the region. While there are some facts to corroborate this (and the local militia are certainly investigating), the evidence for this is lacking.

    #
    personality: |
      Leo plays the role of the pleasant businessman and dutiful family man. His customer service skills are impeccable. But this facade hides a much darker side; he is a ruthless and cunning mastermind, leading a cabal of
      criminals. He is doing his best to live up to the expectaions of his family and the example set by his ancestors. He is confident that he is doing so, and doing so very well. This may or may not be the case
