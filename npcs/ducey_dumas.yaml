# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               proficiency bonus. A Large or larger creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw.
    - content: This great maul has 7 charges. You can use one charge to deal 3d8 extra force damage upon hitting the target. You can use 2 charges to deal 2d12 thunder damage to all other creatures who fail a dex save(DC your

    background-story: |
      Ducey Dumas is one of the more prominent and revered of the Dumas family's seemingly endless pool of "cousins". Like most of the "cousins", no one in nor outside of the family (excepy maybe the family patron)
      really seems to know what their lineage nor their parentage are, but they are a cousin all the same. Ducey is specifically one of the cousins that is called on when serious muscle is required. With their huge size, 
      terrifying rage and magical great maul, they are basically a one person seige engine. Not only are they good at smashing heads, but they're even better when it comes to smashing objects and structures. They are a 
      humanoid-shaped battering ram, and they take great pride and joy in their work.

    personality: |
      Ducey Dumas is an absolute tank of a being. Standing at over 8ft tall and almost as wide, covered in rippling muscles and a grey leather-like hide. Ducey has the facial features of a rhinocerous including the beedy black
      eyes and massive ivory-like double horn. They are generally dressed in shabby, soiled, travelling clothes which tend not to stand-up to the abuse they recieve in a berserker rage and will often just be wearing tattered 
      pants, belt, bracers and boots by the end of a good fight. Ducey is not very smart or wise, but is very very loyal to the Dumas Family, especially cousins Nicodeamus and Saul. They also have a huge crush on cousin Tizzy
      and will go out of their way to impress her and are easily manipulated her. Much like the animals they resemble, Ducey is incredibly nearsighted.  Coupled with their rage, this often makes Ducey as dangerous to their 
      friends as they are to their foes. Because of this, the family tends to send them on missions that require excessive violence, on their own. Ducey is a little ashamed of this limitation and does their best to downplay
      the extent of the problem. Unfortunately for them, they are also about as smart as a bag of hammers, so they aren't very good at pulling off this deception. Ducey is a behemoth that revels in violence and destruction. 
      There is little they enjoy more than devastation they bring to both people and property.
