# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Because of the imposing austerity of the Winterlands, the Orcs of the North, the Grimfang tribe, are known for being especially vicious. Lines of berserkers, polar bear cavalries, and powerful shamans have carved bloody 
      paths of devastation into the surrounding kingdoms. Unknown to the broader public, the Grimfang tribe has derived their ruthlessness from a desire to protect themselves from the strategic and unethical assaults of 
      the Northern Dwarven and Elven alliances. Separated from his tribe during a heavy skirmish, Deonne was held and tortured by the Inquisitors of the North seeking the hearth of the King of the Grimfang. Tortured over 
      and over without giving up any information, he was abandoned for dead. Trudging through the bitter winter landscape, he eventually found a family of traveling merchants who took pity on the cowering, shivering youth hidden
      off the side of a trading route. They took him in as an adopted son. Eventually finding Solace in the Church of the Poet of Justice [Hoar or some similar God of Revenge], Deonne has since committed his life to 
      gaining retribution for the little known evils of the allied nations. While this serves as his over arching life-goal, he has settled himself into a rewarding juxtapositional life of providing comfort and respite to 
      travelers of the Realms, dwarves and elves alike, to offer the comfort and compassion that he and his peoples never received. Noble in presence, Deonne is committed to a life governed by natural law and the order 
      civilization brings to the masses. Although resentful of the factions responsible for the unethical treatment of his tribe, he recognizes that town and city officials must bring order for their people, and he believes that
      religious factions are more capable of this than politicians and magistrates.
