# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

       - Bonus Proficiencies: Proficiency with Heavy Armor and Smith's Tools
       - Blessing of the Forge: you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of 
                                your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon. Once you use this feature,
                                you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
       - Channel Divinity - Artisans Blessing: you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items. You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal; a simple or martial weapon, a 
                                               suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice 
                                               on a surface within 5 feet of you. The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, 
                                               with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. 
                                               The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.
       - Soul of the Forge: your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities; You gain resistance to fire damage. While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC
       - Divine Strike: you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8
                        fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
       - Saint of Forge and Fire: your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful; You gain immunity to fire damage. While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage 
                                  from nonmagical attacks.

    #
    background-story: |
      Crusible Firepeak grew up as a typical Bugbear; rough, angry, violent and viscious. A clan of savages who raided, warred and murdered without remorse. Unfortunately his clan raided someone they shouldn't have, a powerful
      demon hiding in human form ruling over a wealthy keep. It proved to be the last raid they ever went on. The demon's forces annihilated his clan except for a few members that were kept for torturing at the demon's leasure. 
      Crusible, who then went by the name Torog, was one such unlucky individual. After long months of torture, Torog was slated to be burned at the stake as one final retribution for the clan's insolence in daring to attack. 
      But the fire refused to take Torog. Surrounded by flames, a higher purpose was revealed to Torog by the Gods of the Forge, and Crusible Firepeak was born. Surviving the flames Crucible fled from the demon, and found a 
      forge where he could learn the trade to honour his saviours and embark on his new path. Swearing revenge against all those that inhabit the Abyss, he pursued his new calling with furvor, until he caught the eye of The 
      Phantom and became the smith and weaponer for the Dead Hunters

    # Required.

    #
    personality: |
      Crusible Firepeak is a massive specimen. What little hair he has is short cropped and shaved close, a very odd choice for a bugbear, but mostly due to his baptism in fire. What's left of the hair on his ursine face, is 
      patchy and singed. He wears full plate armor underneath the long leather apron covered in grease and scorth marks. Crusible isn't the brightest of fellows, but has become quite adept at his chosen calling of the forge. 
      What he lacks in intelligence he makes up for in passion, industry and devotion to the Gods that saved him. He's not very personable, but he has proven himself to The Phantom as a stalwart ally.
