# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    mannerisms:   Wheeler is almost constantly swaying, as though some shanty is playing in his head. He often bursts into rousing shanties while adventuring or even just browsing a market place. This is especially likely when the ale is flowing.

      He isn't dismayed by slaving, per se, but instead hopes to 'refine' the trade by only including particular races or economic positions. Does he prefer dwarves? The poor? What do the clientele think are the most worthy? Wheeler just goes with it.

  - abilities: 
    - title: Breath Weapon
    - content: When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw 
               (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 Fire damage. On a successful save, it takes half as
               much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
    - title: Draconic Resistance
    - content: You have resistance to Fire damage.
    - title: Metallic Breath Weapon
    - content: At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath
               is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one
               Enervating Breath - Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
               Repulsion Breath - Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.
               Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

    background-story: |
      A largely forgotten child of a wealthy Dragonborn family nearly obliterated by discriminating Elven and Human armies, Captain Wheeler became something of a man-whore chasing females for personal validation. In these
      seedy social circles, he connected with the Violet Conch, a high-sea slaver group who traded in peoples of any race or social class so long as it was profitable. Realizing his opportunity at wealth (and not caring that 
      others would suffer) Captain Wheeler trained with the Violet Conch, learning the 'ropes' of sailing and trading peoples as goods. The process largely wore down his moral compass. Regardless of these heavy 
      experiences, Wheeler (renamed by his sailmates - his original name only known to him at this point) is well known as the 'beast who inspires' or the 'spirit of the wandering sailor' because of his profound fecundity with 
      respect to sea-shanties. Those shanties have become even more renown because of their magical effects - often saving sailors and their ships in crisis
