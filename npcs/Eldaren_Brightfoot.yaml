# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Always the ham of his large family, Eldaren had an innate talent to entertain others, whether that be through song, dance, or comedy. It simply came natural. His family were very supportive of this talent and young Eldaren
      quickly became a popular feature in his village performing in full-on stage productions, strumming a lute in the local tavern, or all-dressed-up in his famously ridiculous clowning garb and performing long mime sequences
      in the village square. His name eventually became known among other connected towns and cities. Eldaren's talents were requested by playwrights and tavern keepers throughout the region. He soon became a recognizable
      celebrity with passers-by remarking, "I saw your performance of Gonidorin in 'the Leaves will Fall as they May!" or something equally astounded. Only the erudite recognize that many of his performances have a hidden
      message promoting freeing the commoners from the clutches of the royalty.
