# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Raskolnik was born to a low-ranking court bureaucrat father, who was intelligent to the point of unfulfilled dreams, and a moderately wealthy mother, whose inheritance was spent before her children knew the words "dice", 
     "wine" or "whores". Raskolnik's father was inadvertently trampled by a mail coach when Raskolnik was a young child. His mother, now without income and living in poverty in a grand manse among the snow elves, had little 
     choice but to sell the remnants of her inheritance and take up residence in the squalid slums with the orcs and goblins of the north. Raskolnik's mother said, on more than one occasion, "We elves are not known for helping
     the downtrodden, even our own kind." Raskolnik excelled at his studies, and was noticed by an orcish ambassador to the north for winning second prize in the "Essays from the Ghetto" contest. His prose and unorthodox, even
     mildly disturbing, thesis had captured the imagination of the fiery, blunt orc. The orcish ambassador gave Raskolnik's mother a small sum to pay for his studies in law, on the promise that she would send him to "anything 
     but a pale-skinned school of fascist pig-donkeys." Raskolnik's mother, partly from gratitude to her son's orcish benefactor, and partly from anger at her own culture's complete detachment from her financial predicament,
     readily agreed. Raskolnik went to a law school run by halflings. (When the orcish diplomat found out, he flew into a rage. He had envisioned a green-skinned school for green-skinned law. But that is another story that shall
     not be told here.) His studies were spectacularly successful. The halflings considered Raskolnik one of their own. But the humans were next to adopt him. During a multi-racial rhetoric competition in a prominent northern
     city, Raskolnik won second place overall.  The human judge took him aside after the debate and told him that he had the potential to be a great leader, a great statesman. The human asked for a written essay that he could
     take to his superiors in the middle lands, and in return, the human would pave the path to a fulfilling career in the human legal system. Raskolnik submitted his magnum opus to the human, sending a 20,000 word thesis on the
     nature of The Great Man to his would-be human benefactor. The human published it under his own name and went on a book-signing tour, only to be murdered by an orc on his yacht in the south (though that tale of greed,
     debauchery and violence is another story, and shall not be told here.) Raskolnik, blissfully unaware of his human would-be-benefactor's fate, continued to wait, hopefully, for word from the human. He had finished law school.
     He sold what he owned and borrowed money from a disreputable lender. He tried valiantly to support his mother and younger sister. Raskolnik's sister agreed to marry a rich, abusive man. Raskolnik became desperate. Meanwhile,
     word had -- unbeknownst to Raskolnik himself -- gotten out that he was the actual author of the human's stolen manuscript. Raskolnik was known only by name -- not by appearance -- to be an ubermensch, a believer in Great
     Men who are justified in trampling the Inferior. Soon, Raskolnik will discover that the local constabulary have read his treatise, and suspect him of murdering the moneylender in order to pave the way to Greatness.
     Raskolnik is riddled with guilt, not entirely for killing the woman (he partly believes she deserved it), but also for not being Great like he should be: for not being able to carry through with his own ambitions, for not
     being able to Act in the way that Great Men Act.

    #
    personality: |
     Raskolnik was a bright upcoming star of legal and political thought, unfortunately due to circumstances mostly beyond his control, is now nervous, on edge, easily frightened, secretive, mysterious, defensive, yet also
     desperately seeking someone to whom he can confess. And he still has no money to save his sister from what Raskolnik sees as a terrible, terrifying union.
