# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Wendy Gol was born to farmers in the village of Eldwynn [A small Human settlement] in the plains of Overmarsh Gale [Any broad plain of rich, fertile soil]. Having a humble and challenging upbringing as the youngest of 3 
     brothers and 4 sisters, Wendy sought the recognition of both parents, even when she married a well-respected farmer's son from an adjacent farm. Her longing for love and attention was never fulfilled and, as might be 
     expected, Wendy was treated much like an employee of the farm and as a child by her husband. This lack of recognition and attention was so profound that Wendy would often wander towards the sparse woods nearby which she 
     heard from her siblings contained caves and steppes that were home to covens of witches who were known to wield great magicks. Her mundane life drove her to the excitement of trying to uncover where this coven was hiding.
     Upon her 21st birthday, recieving no celebrations, Wendy made her usual trip to the woods nearby. Upon entering the shade of the canopies she heard a whisper in the back of her mind. "We are here. We have been watching. 
     You are welcome, sister." Shocked and elated, Wendy drove deeper into the woods until she came upon a chipped and cracked carving out of the steppe wall surrounded by entageled roots and vines. A beautiful elven face slowly
     advanced from the darkness of the cave and into the light. Smiling, the Elven woman said, "Welcome, sister. We have been waiting" and she gently beckoned Wendy to enter the cave. Wendy cautiously entered the cave which was 
     populated by 4 beautiful elven women dressed in wondrous garments standing around a fire. The four held hands to form a circle, yet leaving one spot open. "Come girl", one said, "find your true place in this world". Wendy 
     joined the circle and was suddenly filled with a surge of disgust, hatred, and bilious discontent. "We pledge to thee, dear Wendy, that you will never be ignored again!" At this moment, Wendy's husband, who had been 
     following her into the woods for sometime to investigate what his wife was up to, burst into the cave. "You vile creatures, leave her be!" He shouted. Cackling, the coven charmed the young man and demanded that Wendy 
     consume him with them if she were to truly become something more than a farmer's daughter. Having been charmed herself, Wendy followed their demands. Cackling as Wendy's once beautful appearance withered into that of an 
     old, wicked hag, the coven surged in a circle of blue and green electrical ethereal energy that concluded with a blast of light centered upon Wendy who promptly squatted and laid an egg. The coven cackled in concert yet 
     again as the egg hatched and a chick stumbled forth with a head that was an exact replica of her husband. One member of the coven snatched the fleeing chick and forced it down Wendy's throat, crying in a crackled voice, 
     "henceforth you will be Wendigola, she who lost her beauty to her longing..." Reluctantly reborn and recognizing she hadn't gained the power and comradery she had expected, Wendigola fled the cave as the coven's cackling 
     slowly faded away among the interstices of the steppes and trees.

    personality: |
     Wendigola's mind is mostly gone now, any semblance of Wendy is long gone. She still studies and plays at alchemy, trying to capture the promised power she was deprived, but has yet to be able to acomplish much of anything. 
     She is mad and abrasive and about as socially awkward as a human can be.
