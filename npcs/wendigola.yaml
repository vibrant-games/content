    background-story: |
      <p>Wendy Gol was born to farmers in the village of Eldwynn [A small Human settlement] in the plans of Overmarsh Gale [Any broad plain of rich, fertile soil]. Having a humble and challenging upbringing as the youngest of 3 brothers and 4 sisters, Wendy sought the recognition of both parents, even when she married a well-respected farmer's son from an adjacent farm. Her longing for love and attention was never fulfilled and, as might be expected, Wendy was treated much like an employee of the farm and as a child by her husband. This lack of recognition and attention was so profound that Wendy would often wander towards the sparse woods nearby which she heard from her siblings contained caves and steppes that were home to covens of witches who were known to wield great magicks. Her mundane life drove her to the excitement of trying to uncover where this coven was hiding.</p><p>Upon her 21st birthday, recieving no celebrations, Wendy made her usual trip to the woods nearby. Upon entering the shade of the canopies she heard a whisper in the back of her mind. <i>"We are here. We have been watching. You are welcome, sister."</i>Shocked and elated, Wendy drove deeper into the woods until she came upon a chipped and cracked carving out of the steppe wall surrounded by entageled roots and vines.</p><p>A beautiful elven face slowly advanced from the darkness of the cave and into the light. Smiling, the Elven woman said, <i>"Welcome, sister. We have been waiting"</i> and she gently beckoned Wendy to enter the cave.</p><p>Wendy cautiously entered the cave which was populated by 4 beautiful elven women dressed in wondrous garments standing around a fire. The four held hands to form a circle, yet leaving one spot open. <i>"Come girl"</i>, one said, <i>"find your true place in this world".</i> Wendy joined the circle and was suddenly filled with a surge of disgust, hatred, and bilious discontent. <i>"We pledge to thee, dear Wendy, that you will never be ignored again!"</i>At this moment, Wendy's husband, who had been following her into the woods for sometime to investigate what his wife was up to, burst into the cave. <i>"You vile creatures, leave her be!"</i>He shouted. Cackling, the coven charmed the young man and demanded that Wendy consume him with them if she were to truly become something more than a farmer's daughter. Having been charmed herself, Wendy followed their demands. Cackling as Wendy's once beautful appearance withered into that of an old, wicked had, the coven surged in a circle of blue and green electrical ethereal energy that concluded with a blast of light centered upon Wendy who promptly squatted and laid an egg. The coven cackled in concert yet again as the egg hatched and a chick stumbled forth with a head that was an exact replica of her husband. One member of the coven snatched the fleeing chick and forced it down Wendy's throat, crying in a crackled voice, <i>"henceforth you will be Wendigola, she who lost her beauty to her longing..."</i></p><p>Reluctantly reborn and recognizing she hadn't gained the power and comradery she had expected, Wendigola fled the cave as the coven's cackling slowly faded away among the interstices of the steppes and trees.</p>
