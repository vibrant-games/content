# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

   - - School of Lore Mastery Abilities:
       - Lore Master: you become an increasingly broader compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Choose one skill from Arcana, History, Nature or Religion. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that 
                      uses the chosen skill if you are proficient in that skill. At levels 6, 10 and 14 you get to choose one more skill from the list. In addition, your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, 
                      rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice). Your proficiency bonus is also doubled for any ability check that uses
                      the Investigation skill if you are proficient in that skill. neither this feature nor the previous feature gives proficiency in any skill           
       - Spell Secrets: you start to master your first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies. Choose two damage types from acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant or thunder. When you 
                        cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and the spell deals one of the chosen damage types you can substitute that damage type with another (previously) chosen damage type from the list. You can use this 
                        feature a number of times equal to your Inteligence Modifier (minimum of once~ and only a single damage type may be substituted per spell You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. At 
                        levels 6, 10 and 14 you get to choose two more damage types from the list. Additionally, when you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from
                        one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
       - Arcane Analyser: you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic
                          into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend. An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, 
                          increase the damage against one target of your choice by 2dl0 force damage. lfthe spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell. An 
                          additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell's range. If the spell's range is at least 30 feet, it's range is tripled, or it becomes 1/4 of a mile (whichever is greater) An additional 3rd-
                          level spell slot can increase the spell's potency. Increase the spell's save DC by 2 for one turn against all targets.

    background-story: |
      After years in the city of Hula-krah [Any sky city in the Plane of Air] as a Peacekeeper and high-ranking military official, overlooking the material planes in all their woes, Aeureek decided it was the duty of her 
      people to bring justice to the ground. She conferred with officals and family about her decision and they were all in agreeance; it was time for the people of the sky to bring the freedom of true justice to the greedy 
      land-dwellers. Aeureek and numerous other worthy and authorized members of the community were sent on their way to aid the ground-dwellers. Aeureek settled into the crime-ridden town of Helmsloft [Any major city that 
      could suffer from heavy crime] and confidently approached the town's magistrates. She provided a convincing speech as to how the city required changes to their policing and corrections training and the corresponding 
      structures. With her regal appearance and voice supporting a well-thought out and honest speech, which included numerous accurate observations Aeureek had gathered from his observations in the clouds, the magistrates 
      were convinced to make such changes. Aeureek was offered a position among the magistrates but firmly declined, asserting that her abilities would best suit a position among the officers and within the confines of the 
      slums and markets. Since then, Aeureek has been a well-respected and often feared officer and an advisor to the magistrates.

    #
    personality: |
      Aeureek's bird-like features are akin to that of a falcon with featehrs of whites, browns and greys; She has died various feathers bright reds and purples. She maintains exceptional posture at all times and is always 
      dressed in formal white magistrate's gowns. She is all business in her role as an advisor to surface-dwelling magistrates, but is also exceptionally vain and constantly fusses over her appearance.
