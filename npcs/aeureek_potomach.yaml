    background-story: |
      <p>After years in the city of Hula-krah [Any sky city in the Plane of Air] as a Peacekeeper and high-ranking military official, overlooking the material planes in all their woes, Aeureek decided it was the duty of her people to bring justice to the ground. She conferred with officals and family about her decision and they were all in agreeance; it was time for the people of the sky to bring the freedom of true justice to the greedy land-dwellers. Aeureek and numerous other worthy and authorized members of the community were sent on their way to aid the ground-dwellers.</p><p>Aeureek settled into the crime-ridden town of Helmsloft [Any major city that could suffer from heavy crime] and confidently approached the town's magistrates. She provided a convincing speech as to how the city required changes to their policing and corrections training and the corresponding structures. With her regal appearance and voice supporting a well-thought out and honest speech, which included numerous accurate observations Aeureek had gathered from his observations in the clouds, the magistrates were convinced to make such changes. Aeureek was offered a position among the magistrates but firmly declined, asserting that her abilities would best suit a position among the officers and within the confines of the slums and markets. Since then, Aeureek has been a well-respected and often feared officer and an advisor to the magistrates.</p>
