# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its 
               reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at

               save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who speaks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, avoiding violence
               unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of
               its allies. If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it. 
    - title: Mantle of Majesty
    - contnet: You gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast Command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of 
               unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast Command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without 
               expending a spell slot. Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
               finish a long rest.
    
  - title: Attacks
  - content: 1 attack with short sword or spell
  - title: Combat Tactics
  - content: Hehliad will reluctantly engage with combatants if she feels she has the upper hand (because of numbers or the effects of her spells and performances). Otherwise, she seeks a respectable escape.

  - title: Special Equipment
  - abilities:
    - title: Mac-Fuirmidh Cittern
    - content: An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist each named after a legendary bard college. A
               creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage. You can use an action to play the instrument and cast
               one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. You can
               play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a
               somatic or a material component. All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells - fly invisibility levitate and protection from evil and good. In addition the Mac-Fuirmidh
               cittern can be used to cast barkskin cure wounds and fog cloud.

    background-story: |
      Hehliad was born and raised in Polsgaard, the capital city of the region and where the royal magistrates reside. As a child, her parents would bring her to the numerous festivals held on behalf of the nobility and her
      young mind could imagine doing nothing else with her life than perform and contribute to the kind of joy experienced there. Studying her craft throughout her younger years, she caught the attention of one of the lower
      magistrates who enlisted her as his assistant and a discerning eye for festival talents. It wasn't long before she was given the role of Master of the Revels and took charge to create some of the most memorable events in
      recent history.
