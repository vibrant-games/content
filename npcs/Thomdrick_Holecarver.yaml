# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Thomdrick Holecarver is a rough and rugged deep dwarf. He is not the smartest tool in the shed, but he has learned well from his mentor Silas Urthodon. He has trained with Silas for aboutr 75 years, and while his mental 
      accumen hasn't allowed him to master the medical side of the profession, he is a good hand at the more physical aspects of the job. The man can dig a grave in about half the time it takes a regular person. Though 
      traditionally, like most Duergar, a follower of Asmodeus, Thomdrick has also signed up to work for the patron devil of the Dumas Family. He has also learned a lot of the more duplicitous skills that his mentor has been 
      willing to teach him. He has spent time cultivating his mentor's contacts in the funeral industry, as well as within The Watch/City Guard and the city's underworld. He's an old fashioned pessimist of a Duergar and as such 
      has a very contenious relationship with jovial head of the Dumas Family, Nicodeamus. Though he will do as he's told, he will do so with a grimmace and could possibly be persuaded to turn on Nicodeamus as long as it was in 
      secret it didn't effect his standing in the rest of his life.

    #
    personality: |
      Thomdrick Holecarver is a very typical looking Duergar; He's short, wide and wirey. He has gray, ashey skin and a long, scruffy, unkempt beard. He dresses in dirty work overalls and a brown "Andy Capp" style hat 
      pulled down low over his eyes and bald head. He is a gruff and simple man. He works hard, he drinks hard, he fights hard, and would stab you in the throat as soon as look at you. He's hard to get along with and with 
      the exception of Silas, he prefers to keep to himself and do his work, but he wont back down from anyone.
