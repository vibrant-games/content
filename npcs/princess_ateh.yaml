# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    #
    background-story: |
     Princess Ateh may or may not be a princess anymore. Her peoples' kingdom of Jujubalanah [A halfling kingdom that has been lost (or maybe not!)] did not fair well in the Goblin and Hobgoblin raids of the Dark Reckoning of
     Rakosh Ghaal [Any Goblinoid or Orcish Deity]. Largely razed to the ground, Jujubalanah was once a bright kingdom populated by loving and generous halfings and their ilk. Ateh was among their best. Having been driven from
     her kingdom by war and subsequently hunted by the viscious dark forces of Rokash Ghaal, Ateh now remains in hiding yet continues her well-skilled political performances for various factions within the realms to promote
     equality and abundance. Her peoples believed in the beauty imparted by by Ku, her peoples concept of a central spiritual entity. The philosophy of Ku dictates that all things happen at the same time and that time is merely
     the gift of enjoying every moment that has or will exist. Her beliefs fuel her beauty and her beauty fuels her beliefs
 
      
    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Ateh is sweet and bright and devoted to her people and their future. She can be slightly flaky in the way that artists can be. She knows that she is still being hunted and it worries her, but not as much as the plight of
     her people worries her.
