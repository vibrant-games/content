    background-story: |
      <p>Princess Ateh may or may not be a princess anymore. Her peoples' kingdom of Jujubalanah [A halfling kingdom that has been lost (or maybe not!)] did not fair well in the Goblin and Hobgoblin raids of the Dark Reckoning of Rakosh Ghaal [Any Goblinoid or Orcish Deity]. Largely razed to the ground, Jujubalanah was once a bright kingdom populated by loving and generous halfings and their ilk. Ateh was among their best. Having been driven from her kingdom by war and subsequently hunted by the viscious dark forces of Rokash Ghaal, Ateh now remains in hiding yet continuesher well-skilled political performances for various factions within the realms to promote equality and abundance.</p><p>Her peoples believed in the beauty imparted by by Ku, her peoples concept of a central spiritual entity. The philosophy of Ku dictates that all things happen at the same time and that time is merely the gift of enjoying every moment that has or will exist. Her beliefs fuel her beauty and her beauty fuels her beliefs.</p>
