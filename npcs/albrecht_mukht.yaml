# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Brushing his dreadlocks from his eyes, Albrecht stares down the elves approaching his work site. "Oy, git yer dirty feet off this site! Yer gonna taint the beauty of my work!" He snarls, spitting in their 
      direction. The two elves remark to each other about the rarity they see nailing shingles to the roof of the new tavern. A half-orc? A feral dwarf? They cannot be certain. His muscular body and scars tell a story 
      of a man who is not civilized, per se. A man who would unleash rage upon them. The elves depart. The progeny of a Dwarven slave woman who answered to Orcish slavers in a barbaric tribe, Albrecht had no true connection 
      to family, as one might know it, except to hate others and unleash rage upon those who challenge him. Tired of the poor and sloppy indulgences of his tribe, Albrecht sought greater wealth and power. He followed a 
      trading caravan he saw passing in the distance of the plains, offering to help them with any repairs or services they might need. He continued on with this 'hired-hand' type business upon arriving in the town of 
      Meership Downs, a small sailing port and bustling sea-side community. Here he grew his talents, but also his hatred for other races as the village was frequented by many types of people carousing, drinking, fighting, 
      and all-around ne'er-do-wells. Now, Albrecht focuses on having his 'stamp' on as many buildings, ships, wagons, and so forth, as he possibly can. He puts his anger and hatred into his work knowing that unleashing his 
      rage would not only be dangerous for others, but most certainly for himself.

    personality: |
      Stout and muscular - barrel shaped; 5'5"; Tanned reddish brown skin; Deep brown dreadlocks with blonde highlights; various scars on his body and one across his right eye. While in the process of performing some roofing 
      or general repairs he may shout out to ask a party to pitch-in for some gold in return. May also approach sinister looking adventurers with an offer to 'free the land' from the vile clutches of humans or some other race 
      and ask him/her to 'off' a few members of said race. Easily distracted; Will forego tasks to complete a puzzle; carries small wooden sliding puzzles he built wherever he goes and uses them to answer to problems he's 
      facing; always pointing out the differences between the races yet can't tell the difference between members of the same race. A paradoxically deeply racist multi-racial individual, Albrecht experiences his greatest joy 
      when human or elven populations are diminished in numbers. He is also highly driven to have a hand in as many building projects in his current town or city so he can brag about his renown.
