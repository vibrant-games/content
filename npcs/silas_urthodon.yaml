# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Silas Urthodon is a long-time friend of the Dumas Family, and clocking in at around 700 years old, has taken care of their funeral arrangements for generation. He has also had casual contact with the family's patron 
      for almost as long and has helped him guide them to where they are now. As part of his job he is well suited to providing raw materials for The Dumas' growing force of undead as well as disposing of waste from the 
      family's sacrifical rites. Due to his skills, honed over centuries, Silas has also taken on other roles to make a living. He sometimes hires himself out to The Watch or City Guard as a coroner to help them out with 
      murder investigations. He also hires himself out to insurance companies to investigate mysterious deaths. Both of these jobs not only let him exercise his mind, but also to cover for the Dumas Family in any cases that 
      may involve them. He also knows humanoid bodies inside and out, which makes him well suited to perform medical procedures, a service he provides for members of the family in need as well as various criminal organizations 
      and underworld sources.  

    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.

    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Silas Urthodon is a shady fellow. He has fairly typical Drow features. Tall, skinny as a rail, pointed ears, with dark blue-gray skin and red eyes. He however, also has a large mop of frizzy white hair. He dresses in 
      ceremonial, fine, black, gentleman's clothing and sports a wide-brimmed, black top hat with a silver band around it. He is highly intelligent and very good at his jobs. He has faithfully served at the side of the Dumas 
      Family and their patron for generations, while also managing to serve his own interests quite well throughout that time. As he's gotten on in age, his physical prowess has degraded, but he's still sharp as a tack and 
      not quite as infirmed as he pretends to be and is still capable of putting up a fight if things come to that. Due to his age and impending mortality, Silas has taken on an apprentice; A comparatively younger and much 
      more physically robust Deurgar named Thomdrick Holecarver.
