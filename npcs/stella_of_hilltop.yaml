# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Hilltop [Village; Town] is a quiet halfling town located on a well-used trade route. This has conditioned the population to become diverse in their skillsets and relatively wealthy overall - compared to other halfling
     settlements. With all the coming and going of people and voluminous exchange of coins, goods, and services, people can get lost. When people get lost and nobody comes looking for you, well, then what do you do? A lecherous
     and ornery halfling grain and feed merchant from the nearby economic centre of Invasaad [Major City] was traveling through Hilltop with his "best employees", his three young daughters. The girls would heave the sacks of
     grain and feed on and off the cart or sometimes would be responsible for interacting with immediate buyers. In one transaction, the feed had been hauled onto the buyer's cart whilst Stella - the youngest of the 3 sisters -
     was bargaining for the first time with a crotchety old woman who couldn't afford to feed her goats. "I'll give ya two silver, nothin more! My husband has passed and we 'ad no children. I'm left to me own devices!
     'Ave pity on an old lady". Remembering how her father would deal abusively with her sisters whenever they returned with less than he expected, Stella continued to bargain. In the meanwhile, her father, who had grown
     tired of feeding a third child and who had resigned himself to cutting down the weakest buffalo, had carried on in the cart out of town. Stella continued to barter, none the wiser, until the argumentative customer wouldn't
     budge. She looked back for her father's approval and saw no cart, no father, no sisters. Stella ended the barter, panicked. She raced around town thinking that her father had other dealings. He was nowhere to be found.
     Young Stella wept in the square. Eventually that evening a kind elderly halfling woman approached the weeping figure. She comforted her. Told her their were bigger problems. Bigger problems that needed solutions. The
     kind elderly halfling lady told Stella, "you're from where you choose to be from. You can be Stella of Hilltop". The name stuck and Stella quickly became a surrogate child to the people of Hilltop. Her father never did
     return.

    personality: |
     Stella is a determined young lady. Being abandoned by her family has left her cautios to trust anyone, but her adopted family has made her strong and confident. She wears her heart on her sleeve and has turned her ire
     towards those of wealth, like the father who abandoned her. Her indignance has led her to join the resistance against the ruling class though her health issues do limit her ability to participate in physical combat
