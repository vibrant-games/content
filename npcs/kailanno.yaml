# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Kailanno is an accomplished and well-traveled guide and adventurer. He knows the major rivers of Zendikar like the back of his hand. He was a follower of the Cosi Creed and followed the path of Cosi the Trickster God.
      Unfortunately, with the arrival of the Eldrazi and resulting war for the survival of Zendikar, it was revealed that Cosi was not a God, but one of the Eldrazi Titans; Kozilek.  This revelation has cause the bulk of
      Zendikar's merfolk to abandon their gods, but Kailanno still maintains many of his beliefs and habits, despite no longer believing in Cosi himself. Because of this, he enjoys playing sleight of hand tricks, card tricks
      and even stealing small baubles and trinkets from the people he's guiding. This has gotten him in trouble more than once

    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.

    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Kailanno is a boastful about his abilities, but can back them up. There are few better river guides out there. He is sly and cunning and has been know to sell his his customers down the river so to speak. He also has
      sticky finger and while he makes a decent living, he frequently steals for the fun of it. He collects all kinds of baubles and oddities and is not at all remorseful about relieving them from his customers when they
      aren't looking
