# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Praxius came into the world bred to be a champion, like his father and grandfather. And for a time, he was. Though age began to show its mark and he found he just couldnt adventure like he used to. He wandered for a while
     after trying to find a new purpose, until he came across an abandoned bar within the city. He remembered his earlier days of how sometimes he just wanted to stop at a bar that didn't have constant fights or underworld
     presence at every turn. He spent the last of the gold he had repairing it and establishing contacts. Through the deals he made (and broke) he slowly learnt the tools of the trade of haggling, and now Praxxys is a thriving
     bar in the city. Though Praxius does lament a desire to adventure again, especially after seeing Lucia grow up into a fine businesswoman herself.

    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.

    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
     Praxius is a pleasant and hospitable gentleman. He isn't the greatest of businessmen, but he's learning, and he naturally has a pretty good sense of what is a good deal and what isn't. He loves his surrogate daughter and
     just wants a profitable but peaceful life for the both of them. He does however have slight pangs of missing his adventurous ways of his old days.
