    background-story: |
      <p>Abandoned as a child and raised in orphanages, he had an early pension for catching and dissecting small animals. As he got older he found out he could do that for a living without people shunning him for it.</p><p>He found a kindly butcher in town and became his apprentice. He took to the trade light lightning and quickly far surpassed the abilities of his mentor. When it came time for his mentor to retire, Orfthall took over the business and has excelled. However, as skilled as Orfthall is, he's not immune to the fluctuations of the market and has from time to time, passed off lesser meats as better cuts, especially in his sausage.</p>
