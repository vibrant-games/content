   - - Order of the Profane Soul Abilities:
       - Otherworldly Patron: you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice; the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed in the Player’s Handbook, the Undying within the Sword Coast Adventurer’s 
                              Guide, and the Celestial or Hexblade in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. Your choice augments some of your order features.
       - Pact Magic: you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook for the Warlock 
                     spell list. Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Spell Slots. The Profane Soul Spellcasting table
                     shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must 
                     expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt,
                     you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The 
                     Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s
                     Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you 
                     can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence 
                     is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the 
                     saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
                     - Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
                     - Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
       - Rite Focus: your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. While you have an active Crimson Rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) for 
                     your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact (outlined below).
         - The Archfey: When you deal rite damage to a creature, it glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature can’t benefit from half cover, three-quarters cover, or being invisible.
         - The Fiend: When you hit a creature with your Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on your hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
         - The Great Old One.: When you score a critical hit against a creature while using the weapon, that creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
         - The Undying: Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a weapon, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.
         - The Celestial: You can expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature as a bonus action to heal one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. They regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft 
                          damage die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).
         - The Hexblade: Whenever you target a creature with a blood curse, your next attack against the cursed creature deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.
       - Mystic Frenzy: when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
       - Revealed Arcana: your dark patron grants you the rare use of a dangerous arcane spell based on your pact.

        - Brand of the Sapping Scar: your Brand of Castigation feature now digs dark, arcane scars into your target, leaving them vulnerable to your magic. A creature branded by you has disadvantage on their saving throws 
                                     against your warlock spells.
        - Unsealed Arcana: your patron grants you the rare use of an additional arcane spell based on your pact.
          - The Archfey. You can cast Slow once without expending a spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
          - The Fiend. You can cast Fireball once without expending a spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

        - Blood Curse of the Souleater: you've learned to siphon the soul from your fallen prey. You gain the Blood Curse of the Souleater for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your number of blood curses 
                                        known.
