# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  special-abilities:
  - title: Changeling (Eberron) Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Change Appearance
    - content: As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.
               You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make
               yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if
               you’re bipedal, you can’t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don’t change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to
               keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.
               Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) 
               check you make to avoid detection.
    - title: Unsettling Visage
    - content: When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses.
               Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest
    - title: Divergent Persona
    - content: You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a unique identity associated with that proficiency; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of
               this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency
    
  - title: Rogue Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Expertise
    - content: Double proficiency bonus with Thieve's Tools and Sleight of Hand
    - title: Sneak Attack
    - content: Once per turn can add 3d6 to one creature she hits with a ranged or finesse attack if she has advantage on the attack or if the target is engaged with another creater
    - title: Cunning Action
    - content: Can take a bonus action on each turn to Hide, Disengage or Dash
    - title: Steady Aim
    - content: At 3rd level, as a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus 
               action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn
               
  - title: Arcane Trickster Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Spellcasting
    - abilities:
    - title: Spell DC
    - content: 14
    - title: Cantrips
    - content: Mage Hand, Mind Sliver, Minor Illusion, Fire Bolt
    - title: 1st Level
    - content: Hideous Laughter, Id Insinuation, Silvery Barbs, Puppet, Magic Missile
    - title: Mage Hand Legerdemain
    - content: When you cast Mage Hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it;
    - content: You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
    - content: You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
    - content: You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.
    - content: You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check. In addition, you
               can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.

  - title: Attacks
  - content: Knife or Spell
  - title: Combat Tactics
  - content: She will hit and run if she needs to martial attack, mostly trying to cause mischief and small wound. Prefers to cast spells 

  - title: Special Equipment
  - abilities:
    - title: Blink Dagger 
    - content: This short, black-bladed throwing knife crackles with blue electricity as it flies through the air. Once attuned, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
    - content: You may use an action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5ft of a creature you can see and make a melee weapon attack with advantage against the creature.
    - content: If the attack hits, the target takes an additional 3d6 lighting damage. Once used, this feature recharges at the next dawn.
    - title: Venomous Crossbow
    - content: Thia Hand Crossbow gives a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with it. However, this hand crossbow has four charges. One charge can be expended to coat your fired bolt with venom.
    - content: On a hit, the target has to make a DC 13 Con save and take 1d6 poison damage. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until their next turn.
    - content: If you expend the last charge in the crossbow, you have to roll a d20. On a natural one, the attached tubes and vessels shatter and spray poison in a large 25-foot sphere.
    - content: Creatures in that sphere have to roll a DC15 Con save and take 1d12 poison damage. On a failed save, they are poisoned for one minute. With that natural one, the crossbow loses all of its magical abilities
    - title: Ring of Evasion
    - content: This ring has 3 Charges, and it regains 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your Reaction to expend 1 of its Charges to succeed on that saving 
               throw instead.
    - title: Ring of Invisibility
    - content: While wearing this ring, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until 
               you use a bonus action to become visible again.

    background-story: |
      Allie Dumas is one of the three Dumas Triplets, two girls and a boy that look to be about 7 years old. The girls are identical twins and the boy also bears a remarkable resemblance. However, in reality, the Triplets are 
      not even related. Sally is a Hexblood while while Allie is a changeling who has bonded with and taken on the appearence of Sally full time, and Pally is a Nezumi rat-folk that wears an almost permanent glamour that 
      makes him resemble his "siblings". The Triplets are counted among the many mysterious "cousins" of the Dumas Family and they seem to mostly thrive on creating chaos and discord for everyone around them. They each use their
      many magical talents to torment their prey du jour. They rarely kill their victims, but prefer to leave them terrified, paranoid and sometimes delusional.

    #
    personality: |
      Allie Dumas, unless required for a good prank, at all times looks and acts exactly like her "sister" Sally, though always defers to her when it comes time for making plans and running pranks. She is completely subserviant
      to her "sister", though it is unknown exactly why, or why she chooses to wear her sisters face at all times when not out sewing chaos. Allie is actually the older of the two girls, though changelings are notoriously 
      difficult to age. Nobody is quite sure how old she actually is, where she came from, and why she has bonded herself to Sally.
