# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

   - - Druid Abilities:
       - Druidic: You know Druidic, the Secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a Message. Others spot the 
                  message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.  
       - Spellcasting: Spell DC 15
         Cantrips: Shillelagh, Druidcraft, Mending
         1st Level: Create Water, Entangle, Goodberry, Speak With Animals
         2nd Level: Pass Without Trace, Heat Metal, Locate Plants or Animals
         3rd Level: Meld Into Stone, Speak to Plants
       - Wild Shape: you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or Long Rest. Your druid level 
                     determines the Beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd Level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a Challenge Rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a 
                     flying or Swimming speed. You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. 
                     You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You automatically revert if you fall Unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die

   - - Circle of Land Abilities:
       - Natural Recovery: you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with Nature. During a Short Rest, you choose expended Spell Slots to recover. The Spell Slots can have a combined level
                           that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

         3rd Level: Barkskin, Spider Climb
         5th Level: Call Lightning, Plant Growth

    background-story: |
     Whispering to an Amyrillis that "the current war will end soon", a young Moss heard a quiet voice in her head. "You have the gift, child." Moss was suddenly struck with a channel of supernatural energy from beyond. Her mind
     was filled with visions of nature while her body was struck with unfortunate disabilities. At this point, when the Goddess of Blooms, without location but existing within every seed and petal, touched her, Moss became aware
     that she was destined for more than a life arranging flowers for others. Moss' real name is lost in time. Raised in a testosterone fueled environment with 3 brothers and a long-passed mother, Moss was beleaguered with
     pseudo-abuse directed towards her womanhood. She absorbed these in her youth, thinking it was normal, but after touched buy the Goddess of Blooms she realized the horrors of which men are capable. In this moment another
     insight was whispered directly into the center of her mind. "Men are but the seeds. Save the soils, milady. Bless the petals. Love the stems. Revere the roots. But we will always be able to produce more seeds."


      
    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Moss has a calling with plants. She loves them and is immaculte in her ability to arrange flowers. She is a bit of an odd contradiction, her idsabilities have left her somewhat jaded with a sharp sarcastic wit, but she is
      also naive in the ways of society. She has a strong distrust and is cautious of men and acively avoids them, but is overly trusting of women and children. She would overall prefer to spend all of her time with plants and
      animals and avoid other people entirely
