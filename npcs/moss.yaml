    #
    # Use this as a template:

    background-story: |
      <p>Whispering to an Amyrillis that <i>"the current war will end soon",</i> a young Moss heard a quiet voice in her head.</p><p>You have the gift, child.</p><p>Moss was suddenly struck with a channel of supernatural energy from beyond. Her mind was filled with visions of nature while her body was struck with unfortunate disabilities. At this point, when the Goddess of Blooms, without location but existing within every seed and petal, touched her, Moss became aware that she was destined for more than a life arranging flowers for others.</p><p>Moss' real name is lost in time. Raised in a testosterone fueled environment with 3 brothers and a long-passed mother, Moss was beleaguered with pseudo-abuse directed towards her womanhood. She absorbed these in her youth, thinking it was normal, but after touched buy the Goddess of Blooms she realized the horrors of which men are capable. In this moment another insight was whispered directly into the center of her mind.</p><p><i>Men are but the seeds. Save the soils, milady. Bless the petals. Love the stems. Revere the roots. But we will always be able to produce more seeds.</i></p>
