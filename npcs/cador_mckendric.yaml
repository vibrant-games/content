    background-story: |
      The very glee and dedication that characterize the Gnomish race is exemplified in Cador. His clan were always obsessed with tinkering and the creation of various gadgets for adventurers' utility, but Cador took this to a new level when he established his inn, "the One Stop". Here he has conjoined his love for respite with his natural proclivity for tinkering. With numerous 'washers' and 'drylines', he offers guests a laundry service for a nominal fee.He has also created what he calls the 'barstop' for his common room. This complex of tubes and steel resembles a 'Hooka' and allows visitors to choose a particular beverage of their choice and have it poured for them. All they need is the receptacle, which are offered in stacks beside the 'barstop'. Cador is currently working on something that will also clean his dish and glassware.Consistently showing off his innovations he is also open to help and feedback on them and on any ideas others might have for providing even better hospitable service to his guests.
