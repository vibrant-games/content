# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    introduction:  Chloe is that 'bored-looking-guard'. She will specifically make contact with adventurers who are passing through that look like they are willing and capable to stir the pot and cause a bit of 'no no' amongst the population.

    # Appearance: a brief description of the character skin, clothes, hair, eyes, etc.
    #
    # Required.

    #             |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    #
    appearance:   Rather plain jane appearance - couldn't be picked out of a crowd; Wearing the armor of the local militia acting as watchmen for the city/town; In off hours, Chloe wears bland dresses and tops but pays close attention to her hair and shoes as though compensating for her rather average appearance

    #
    # Expressions: things the character says all the time, making their speech distinctive.
    # Like, oh my gods!
    # Detritus!
    # Whoah
    # Silly goose
    # etc.
    #
    # Required.
    # Max 120 characters.
    #
    # Use this as a template:

    #
    expressions:  "Can't make wine outta olives - some call me an olive, but I know I'm a cherry!"; "Keeping the peace seems foolhardy when its the Kings and Queens that cause the conflicts in the first place"; "I say 'Stick it to em', gold-hungry scoundrels, they are";

    #
    # Mannerisms: what does the character do with their hands?  And eyes, mouth, etc.
    # Do they tap their feet incessantly?  sniff their own underarms to figure out where the odour
    # is coming from?  Etc.

    #
    mannerisms:   Timid at first glance but courageous in spirit, Chloe will often avoid engaging with others; Order/task oriented - goes from standing still to pointing and gesturing to the next task at hand; Most often found reading through her list of ingredients for her wines and her methods of making them; Sometimes throws a wrench in the gears of watchkeeping

    background-story: |
      Born and bred in the middle class market district of the city of Johseveille [Any major city], Chloe gained both a taste for and disdain for bourgeios comforts. Both of her parents were political advisors and urged Chloe 
      into the same vocation but Chloe was rebellious in her youth, causing all kinds of trouble with local merchants and incoming adventurers. She was particularly notorious for getting so drunk on cherry or apple wine that 
      her teeth would turn colors. One night she broke into a locel wine-maker's facility and stole a small barrel of wine and decanting equipment. Her parents quickly grew tired of this behavior and enrolled her in the local 
      militia. Needless to say, Chloe's dichotomous attitude continued into her years of training with the militia. She enjoyed the challenge and growth but despised the regimen and boundaries. As a coping mechanism to 
      bring more joy to her life, Chloe turned back to wine. She's been charged with dereliction of duty on numerous occasions. However, since her parents are high-ranking political advisors she has protection against any kind 
      of discharge from her duties. Consequently, she floats through her duties during the day and returns to her passion for wine-making at night. She has a small tent outside of her family home within which she practices 
      methods of decanting late into the twilight hours.
