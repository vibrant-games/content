    background-story: |
      <p>Raised in the mountains, Khamal was exiled from his tribe for going into a rage and killing another Goliath during a game of Stubborn-Root. Rather than fending for himself in the mountains, he made his way down into the mainland. After witnessing a gang of orcs attacking a caravan, his sense of fairness required him to intercede and even the odds. The nobles he saved were so grateful that they invited him into their house.</p><p>His massive size, skill and rage served him well in their service and eventually he was given the job of executioner due to his strength and skill with an axe. He wears the executioner's mask as a badge of honor even though it clearly doesn't offer him any anonymity. Lately he has begun to question the rule of those in charge. His culture dictates that those with the best skills for the job should be doing the job, and its starting to become obvious to him that is not the case here.</p>
