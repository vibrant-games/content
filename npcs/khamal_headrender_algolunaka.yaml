# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Raised in the mountains, Khamal was exiled from his tribe for going into a rage and killing another Goliath during a game of Stubborn-Root. Rather than fending for himself in the mountains, he made his way down into the
      mainland. After witnessing a gang of orcs attacking a caravan, his sense of fairness required him to intercede and even the odds. The nobles he saved were so grateful that they invited him into their house.
      His massive size, skill and rage served him well in their service and eventually he was given the job of executioner due to his strength and skill with an axe. He wears the executioner's mask as a badge of honor even
      though it clearly doesn't offer him any anonymity. Lately he has begun to question the rule of those in charge. His culture dictates that those with the best skills for the job should be doing the job, and its starting to
      become obvious to him that is not the case here.

    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Khamal is a very straight-forward man. He knows what he beleives in and has no compunction about fighting for it. He has a strong sense of fair play, right and wrong, and justice. He will always intercede when he feels
      that something is not fair. He has recently begun to realize that the nobles that he works for do not live up to his standards of justice and fairness, and may be starting to lean towards rectifying that wrong, most
      likely with his axe
