    background-story: |
      <p>Enid is a pretty regular young lady just trying to get by. Married off by her family at a young age to an older man. It wasn't long before her husband started abusing her. She did her best to hide the abuse and just go on with her life, but as the years went by, he got worse and worse.</p><p> Finally, in a feat of self-defense, she smothered him in his sleep one night. She did her best to make his death look like an accident, and once he was in the ground, she left her home town and her family and has never looked back. She took one of the only jobs she was qualified for in the new town, and now sells fruit for a grocery company in the market square. It's a job. It pays her bills, and most importantly, she's free of him!</p>
