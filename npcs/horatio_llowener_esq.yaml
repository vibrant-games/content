    background-story: |
      Horatio grew up in the poor part of the city and worked his way through law school. Because of his upbringing, he's a little on the sleazy side and more concerned with making himself rich than he is actually making sure justice is done. He's good at his job, but will happily sell his clients down the river for his own benefit. He does have a little bit of internal struggle about the things he sometimes does for money and this has caused him to have a bit of a drinking problem
