# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      The Hooded Man is actually the long thought dead patriach of the Dumas Family. Only his former wife Anastasia knows who he is. Saul is only a fraction of the man he once was. He was murdered by backstabbing business 
      partners, an event that sent Anastasia into her downward spiral. But that was all part of the family's patrons plan. In order to protect his investment while she learned to control her newfound powers, the patron returned 
      Anastasia's husband from the dead. Saul returned as a mostly blank slate filled only with lust for revenge and the overwhelming desire to protect his former wife. Even in life, Saul was a hulk of a man, but since his 
      return, infused with the patron's power he has become an absolute beast.

    # Personality (or something like that):

    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      The Hooded Man is a massive brute of a man. He stands about 7 feet tall with his entire body obscured by his long shadowcloak. He wears full chain mail armor but it doesn't impede his movement of stealth. He rarely shows 
      his pale, discolored skin or the scars that remain from his murder. The Hooded Man doesn't have much of a personality. His return from the dead didn't leave him with much of a brain. He is silent and cannot speak, only 
      moan. He also cannot be reasoned or bargained with. Anastasia and her patron's control over him is absolute and he only does what they tell him to. He will do everything in his power to protect Anastasia, and his rage in 
      doing so is palpable. He is single mined in his service and will kill anyone or anything he is instructed to.
