                       single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite of your choice that lasts until you finish a short or long rest, or if you aren’t holding the weapon at the end of your turn. When you activate a rite,
                       you lose a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 damage 
                       of the chosen rite’s type. This damage is magical, and increases as you gain levels as a blood hunter, as shown in the Hemocraft Die column of the Blood Hunter table. A weapon can only hold a single active 
                       rite at a time. You learn an additional Primal Rite of your choice at 7th level, and choose an Esoteric Rite to learn at 14th level.
                       Primal Rites Known: 
       - Extra Attack: you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
       - Brand of Castigation: whenever you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite feature, you can choose to sear an arcane brand of hemocraft magic into it (requires no action). You always know the direction to the branded 
                               creature, and each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature suffers psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier 
                               (minimum of 1 damage). Your brand lasts until you dismiss it, or you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand counts as a spell for the purposes of dispel magic, and the spell level is equal to 
                               half of your blood hunter level (maximum of 9th level spell). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Grim Psychometry: you have a supernatural talent for discerning the history surrounding mysterious objects or places touched by evil. When making an Intelligence (History) check to recall information about a darker past 
                           surrounding an object you are touching, or a location you are present in, you have advantage on the roll. The information gleaned often leans towards the more sinister influences of the past, and
                           sometimes conveys visions of things previously unknown to the character on higher rolls.	
       - Dark Augmentation: Your speed increases by 5 feet, and whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
       - Brand of Tethering: the psychic damage from your Brand of Castigation feature increases to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). In addition, a branded creature can’t take the Dash action, and if a creature 
                             branded by you attempts to teleport or leave their current plane via ability, spell, or portal, they take 4d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleport or plane 
                             shift fails.
       - Hardened Soul: you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.
       - Sanguine Mastery: Once per turn, whenever a blood hunter feature requires you to roll a hemocraft die, you can choose to reroll the die and choose which result to use. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with 
                           a weapon attack empowered by your Crimson Rite, you regain one expended use of your Blood Maledict feature.	


   - - Pugilist Abilities:
       - Fisticuffs: your years of fighting in back alleys and taverns have given you mastery over combat styles that use unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons, which are simple melee weapons without the two-handed property, whips,
                     and improvised weapons. You may not use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a pugilist weapon. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or using only pugilist weapons and you are 
                     wearing light or no armor and not using a shield - 
                     - You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or pugilist weapon. This die changes as you gain pugilist levels, as shown in the Fisticuffs column on the Pugilist table.
                     - When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a pugilist weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or grapple as a bonus action.
       - Iron Chin: you can use Constitution instead of Dexterity to determine your armor class when you are wearing light or no armor and are not using a shield.
       - Moxie: your experience laying the beatdown on others has given you a moxie you can channel in the midst of battle. This swagger is represented by a number of moxie points. Your pugilist level determines the maximum number 
                of points you have, as shown in the Moxie Points column of the Pugilist table. You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. You start knowing three such features -  Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick 
                and Move. You learn more moxie features as you gain levels in this class. You regain all expended moxie points when you complete a short or long rest.
                - Brace Up: You can use a bonus action and spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. Roll your fisticuffs die + your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier and gain that many temporary hit points.
                - The Old One-Two: Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 moxie point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
                - Stick and Move: You can use a bonus action and expend 1 moxie point to make a shove attack or take the Dash action.
       - Street Smart: carousing, shadowboxing, and sparring all count as light activity for the purposes of resting for you. Additionally, once you have caroused in a settlement for 8 hours or more, you know all public locations 
                       in the city as if you were born and raised there and you cannot be lost by non-magical means while within the city.
       - Bloodied But Unbowed: when you take damage that reduces you to half your maximum hit points or less, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier and you
                               regain all expended moxie points. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Fight Club: you choose a fight club that best exemplifies your style: Arena Royale, Bloodhound Bruisers, Dog & Hound, Piss & Vinegar, the Squared Circle, or the Sweet Science, all detailed at the end of the class 
                     description. Your fight club grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
       - Dig Deep: you discover a strength inside you that can’t be broken. As a bonus action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for one minute. At the end of that minute you gain a level of 
                   exhaustion.
       - Extra Attack: you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
       - Haymaker: before you make an attack roll with an unarmed strike or pugilist melee weapon attack that does not already have disadvantage, you can declare you are swinging wild haymakers. You make all attack rolls until 
                   the end of this turn with disadvantage and when you deal damage you do not roll, but use the maximum die result instead.
       - Moxie-Fueled Fists: your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
       - Fancy Footwork: you gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws.
       - Shake It Off: you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
       - Down But Not Out: when you use your Bloodied But Unbowed feature you can choose to also use this feature. If you do, you add your proficiency bonus to your damage with unarmed attacks and pugilist weapons for the next 
                           minute. You can use this feature again after you complete a long rest.
       - School of Hard Knocks: You have resistance to psychic damage and gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or unconscious.
       - Rabble Rouser: Once you have taken a long rest by carousing in a settlement, you gain advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation)rolls made against the people who live there.
       - Unbreakable: you gain advantage on Strength,Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 moxie point to reroll it and take the second result.
       - Herculean: your carrying capacity is doubled, and when you deal damage with a melee weapon or unarmed strike to an inanimate object that damage is doubled. Your standing jump distance is the same as your running start 
                    jump distance.
       - Fighting Spirit: when you have 4 levels of exhaustion or fewer and are reduced to 0 hit points, you regain half of your maximum hit points, half of your maximum moxie points, and gain a level of exhaustion. You cannot 
                          use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
       - Peak Physical Condition: your Strength and Constitution ability scores increase by 2 to a maximum of 22. Additionally, when you take a long rest you recover 2 levels of exhaustion instead of 1 and you regain all your 
                                  expended hit dice instead of half your expended hit dice

                           and it can hover (familiars that already have flight speeds keep their value, but lose their walking speed like the others) and it can become invisible with an action.

                                 your weapon on the attack, so, if you use a ranged weapon, like a bow, you can still make any attack from your spirit, like a bite attack. Also, any extra damage, or bonus to attack rolls you gain 
                                 from magical weapons still affect your spirit attacks.
                               - Your spirit's senses overlap yours, so you lose any senses you possess that your spirit doesn't posses with exception to your ethereal sight.
                               - At level 7 your spirit's attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity against nonmagical damage and attacks. When you reach 11th level, you gain temporary

                                you.

       - Vengeful Spirits: when targeting a creature with a spell that forces them to make a Wisdom saving throw you can choose to loose angry spirits along with the spell. Once per short rest, you can use this feature to make 
                           the target make their initial Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed saving throw the spirits torment the target's mind, causing the spell to deal double damage, or last twice as long, your

                          finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
       - Occult Prowess: you gain one of the following features of your choice
                         Extra Attack: You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
                         Potent Spells: You may add your Wisdom modifier to one damage roll of any Shaman spell you cast.
                         In addition, you learn an additional cantrip of your choice from the shaman spell list. It does not count against the number of cantrips you know.
       - Distilled Nature: you can make the spirits cleanse your body at will. You can as an action draw power from the spirits and make them flush through you, ending a one disease or one condition afflicting you. The condition
                           can be either frightened, charmed, blinded, deafened or poisoned. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
       - Shamanic Conduit: your connection to your spirits is more substantial than before and is harder to break. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action, you have advantage on concentration checks to maintain casting the spell until the spell is cast. In addition, when you finish a short rest, you may switch one of your spells prepared through the Mystical Preparation feature with another spell with the ritual tag.
       - Improved Distilled Nature: the spirits' capabilities to protect you have been improved. You can now use the Distilled Feature twice between long rests. In addition, you can as an action expend two uses of Distilled 
                                    Nature at the same time to create a protective barrier of spirits inside of you, protecting yourself from being crippled. Choose one of the following sets of conditions 
                                    - poison and disease
                                    - blinded and deafened
                                    - charmed and frightened
                                    You become immune to the chosen two conditions for the next hour.
       - Ethereal Sight: your affinity with spirits increase to the point where you are able to see any nearby spirits. You gain the ability to see up to 30 feet into the Ethereal plane.
       - Fleeting Soul: when you die, your soul becomes more bound to the material world, even in death. You can be revived by revivify as long as you have been dead for no longer than 1 day. You can always be revived by 
                        reincarnate regardless of how long you have been dead.
       - Master of the Occult: you have reached such wisdom from the spirits of nature that you become a living spirit that can grant yourself spiritual powers. When you roll for initiative and have no spell slots remaining, 
                               you regain 2 spell slots.

         9th Level:
       - Quickening: you gain the ability to enter a trance known as the witch’s quickening. Entering the trance is a bonus action and allows you to see into the Ethereal Plane up to 60 feet for up to one minute. You also gain 
                     insight into the emotional energy surrounding you, letting you know if and what spiritual creatures are within 60 feet, as well as granting you advantage to Wisdom (Insight) checks for the duration. Finally, 
                     while in your quickening, if you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage you can substitute that damage with psychic damage instead. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. 
                     You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
       - Witch Covenant: you choose the Covenant of Blood, the Covenant of Charm, the Covenant of Ruin, the Covenant of Shadows, the Covenant of Silver, The Covenant of Steel or the Covenant of Unity, detailed at the end of the 
                         class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Additionally, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it once without using a spell slot. 
                         You cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. As long as you have a familiar you gain access to spells regardless of the familiar's distance or occupied plane of existence.
       - Binding Rites: you can bind spirits to your service, taking 10 minutes of uninterrupted activity. During this time, the witch enacts the rite of binding depending on which philosophy the witch belongs to. A blood witch 
                        might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit’s service. When you choose a spirit to bind from the list 
                        at the end of this class description, you fill one of your available spell slots with the spirit. The spell slot used is no longer available for casting spells, and it remains unavailable for as long as 
                        the spirit filling it remains bound to you. The spirit is said to be of a level equal to the spell slot filled to bind it. Thus, a Spirit of Passion occupying a 6th level spell slot is a level 6 spirit. 
                        You cannot have more than one spirit with the same name bound at one time. You can have a number of spirits bound equal to the number in the class table. Depending on the type of spirit, you gain certain 
                        benefits while the spirit remains bound and an additional effect when you release the spirit, as detailed in the Binding Rites section. Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow 
                        release as a reaction. Once a spirit has been released, it no longer provides its passive effect and the spell slot it occupied is considered expended. A witch may exchange any spirit they have bound by 
                        performing the ritual as described above.
                        Binding Rites

                               die, you can add the level of the spirit to the damage total. Release. You can release Agony as a reaction when you roll the highest possible number on a damage die. Roll a number of d6s equal to 
                               the spirit's level and add the total to the triggering damage as psychic damage.
                        Desire: Spirits of Desire impress your will onto others and enhance existing desires. Friendly and charmed creatures within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your spells. 
                                Once a creature succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against one of your spells, that creature is immune to this spirit’s passive effect for 24 hours. Release. When you release this spirit as a bonus
                                action, you attempt to charm a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until it
                                takes damage. The spirit's level determines what kind of creature can be charmed. At 3rd level and below, only humanoids and beasts are affected. At 4th level and above, all creatures can be 
                                affected.
                        Empathy: Spirits of Empathy force your enemies to share your pain. While Empathy is bound, whenever a creature deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to retaliate. The creature takes psychic

                                 equal to the triggering damage + the spirit’s level.
                        Envy: Spirits of Envy take from others what they covet for themselves – life. Once on each of your turns, when you damage a creature with an attack or spell while Envy is bound, you regain a number of hit
                              points equal to the level of the spirit. Release. When you deal damage to a creature with an attack or spell you can release Envy as a reaction. When you do so, you gain a number of temporary hit 
                              points equal to the triggering damage.
                        Fear: Spirits of Fear bring nightmares to life. While Fear is bound, you can add your proficiency bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) checks, or double it if you already do. Additionally, creatures provoke 
                              opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach. Release. When Fear is released from its bonds as a bonus action, a number of creatures equal to the
                              spirit's level within 30 feet of you must succeed on Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end 
                              of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
                        Generosity: Spirits of Generosity are always willing to make sacrifices for those who bind them with good intentions. Your spells that restore hit points restore additional hit points equal to the 
                                    spirit's level. Release. You can release Generosity as a bonus action and gift the spirit to an ally within 30 feet of you. The spirit protects the ally, granting them a number of temporary 
                                    hit points equal to 5 times the spirit's level. These temporary hit points last 10 minutes.
                        Guilt: Spirits of Guilt cause your enemies hesitation in acts that would wrong you. While Guilt is bound, when you are attacked you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to AC against that attack equal to
                               the level of the spirit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the spirit's level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Release. When you release Guilt from your 
                               power as a bonus action, one creature you can see within 60 feet has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turn the target can make a Wisdom saving throw 
                               against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.
                        Hate: Spirits of Hate inspire a ferocity in you. When you are damaged by a creature, you can choose to channel Hate and gain advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next 
                              turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the spirit's level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Release. When you damage a creature with a spell or attack you
                              can release Hate as a reaction. Roll a number of d6s equal to the spirit's level and add the total to the triggering damage as necrotic damage.
                        Humility: When you make an ability check with which you are not proficient at disadvantage, the result can not be lower than 8 + the level of this spirit.Release. As a reaction when a creature you can see
                                  makes a saving throw or ability check, you can release Humility from your power to bestow it upon the creature. Add the spirit’s level to the roll. You can do so after the roll, but must decide 
                                  before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
                        Hunger: Spirits of Hunger sustain their binder and deprive their enemies of energy. While Hunger is bound you require no food or water. Release. You can release Hunger as a bonus action to exhaust a 
                                number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to the spirit’s level. A target gains one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A of the Player's Handbook), and cannot be affected by a 
                                Spirit of Hunger for 24 hours.
                        Passion: Spirits of Passion give those who bind them the power to push themselves and others to greater heights of success. While this spirit is bound you can channel Passion when you make an attack roll,
                                 ability check or saving throw, or when an ally within 30 feet of you does, you roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the spirit's 
                                 level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. You lose all remaining dice when you release Passion. Release. You can release Passion as a reaction when you make an attack roll,
                                 ability check, or saving throw. You gain advantage on the roll. Additionally, you and each friendly creature within 30 feet of you gain a d6 that lasts until the end of your next turn. A creature
                                 can expend and roll the d6 when they make an attack roll or ability check, adding it to the total.
                        Pride: Creatures in your presence are more easily filled with a dangerous sense of pride, oversight, and overconfidence. When you make an ability check that is contested by a creature you can see, you

                               creature to a disgraceful fall. The next time the target makes an attack roll or ability check, it does so with disadvantage, and subtracts the spirit’s level from the total.
                        Serenity: Spirits of Serenity bring peace and clarity of thought to those who bind them. You don't need to sleep. Instead, you can meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After 
                                  resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Additionally, if you or any friendly creatures who can see you regain hit points at the end of a short 
                                  rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains a number of additional hit points equal to the level of the spirit. Release. When you release Serenity from your power at

                                disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn. If it misses that attack roll or fails the ability check, roll a number of d6s equal to the spirit's
                                level. The target takes psychic damage equal to the total.

                               spell list equal to the spirit's level. You and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you of know these spells, and always have them prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells an 
                               affected creature can know or prepare. Release. You can release Trust when you take the Help action, as part of that action. When the target makes the attack roll or ability check that you aided, 
                               it can reroll one of the dice once.
                        Valor: Spirits of Valor give those who bind them the power to pull through with confidence against poor odds. While Valor is bound, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saves
                               against being frightened. Release. When you release this spirit as a bonus action, you and a number of creatures equal to the spirit's level that you can see within 30 feet of you are no longer 
                               frightened.
                        Wonder: You radiate an aura of awe when a spirit of Wonder is bound to you. While Wonder is bound, creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to

                                feet of you. A target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be incapacitated and have a speed of 0 until the end of your next turn.
       - Spirit Ward: you learn a rite that offers protection against spirits who wish you or your allies harm. As an action, you can create a spirit ward with a radius of 30 feet, centered on your location. The ward lasts 1 
                      minute and is stationary for the duration. While inside the ward, friendly creatures (yourself included) cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by undead and have resistance to all damage from 
                      incorporeal undead sources. Additionally, if a friendly creature is reduced to 0 hit points within the ward but is not killed outright, the creature becomes stable. You can use this feature 3 times. You 
                      regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 9th level, you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

                                 the spirit. The release effect of the spirit you dismissed is not activated.
       - Channel Spell: damage you deal with spells of 1st level or higher ignore damage resistances of undead and creatures on the Ethereal Plane. In addition, any damage immunities of these creatures become resistances to your 
                        spells of 1st level or higher.
       - Strength of Spirit: you learn to sap additional fortitude from the spirits you bind. When you finish a long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 times the highest level spirit you have bound.
       - Familiar Spirit: when cast find familiar or if you already have a familiar, you can awaken spiritual energy within the animal as part of an additional ritual taking 10 minutes. Once complete, you choose one spirit from 
                          the list at the end of the class description. Its level is equal to your Charisma modifier. Your familiar provides you with the spirit’s passive effect as long as your familiar is within 100 feet of you. 
                          If the familiar dies, the spirit you initially chose produces its release effect if you can see any valid targets within range of the familiar when it dies.
       - Ghostly Step: you gain the ability to enter the spirit realm as a bonus action by projecting part of yourself beyond the material plane. You and your belongings become invisible and incorporeal for up to 1 minute. You 
                       gain resistance to all damage from non-magical sources, and are immune to being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained. During this time, you may move your normal speed and may pass through 
                       solid objects. If you end your turn in an object, you are dealt 1d10 force damage. You may rematerialize in your present location as a bonus action. If you choose to maintain this form until the duration 
                       expires and you are in a location occupied by a creature or solid object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved as a result. 
                       Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
                       
                       
   - - Doctor Abilities:
       - Medical Training: Due to your meticulous study into the healing arts you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for Medicine checks. In addition your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
                           Medicine checks that you make. 
       - Doctors Bag: you gain access to a number of special supplies due to your medical training. These supplies include things like bandages, syringes, medicinal powders, and healing salves. You keep these in a storage
                      container of your choice such as a bag, a series of pouches, or even a trunk. As long as you have access to your Doctor's Bag you may use an action to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without
                      needing to make a Medicine check.
       - First Aid: you can apply basic first aid to an adjacent creature you can touch. As a bonus action you heal the target for 1d4 hit points. This increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th
                    level (4d4). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier + 1. You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
       - Second Opinion: you have become accustomed not only to combat, but to coordinating with other healers. Whenever an ally within 20ft of you uses a healing ability, spell, or item, you can use your reaction to increase
                         the amount healed to a single target by half, rounded up. Your ally must be able to see or hear you.
       - Patch Up: you have learned that there is always another fight around the corner, and it's best to be ready for it. Select up to 6 willing creatures that you can touch. You spend the next 10 minutes quickly stitching up
                   any open wounds and applying painkillers where needed, whatever it takes to get them to the next battle. This cures them of any non-magical ailments and restores a number of hit points equal to half of their

       - Diagnosis: you have learned to treat hostile scenarios as just another day at the office. As an action you study a living creature and gain vital insight towards its physical state. You learn one of the targets
                    following statistics - Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, Highest Saving Throw, Lowest Saving Throw, or whether or not the creature is below half its health. You can use this
                    feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.
       - Paramedic: you have become experienced at reaching the injured without taking damage. When you use your action to disengage you may also double your movement speed until the end of your turn
       - Vaccination: you have spent countless hours attempting to aid those suffering from disease and have developed a number of treatments. As an action you can cure a target of a single disease afflicting them. Alternatively,
                      you can inoculate a target against disease for the next 24 hours. In addition, due to exposure from numerous patients the doctor gains immunity to all disease.
       - Vitality Boost: you have become an expert at healing at a moment’s notice. As an bonus action you can heal an adjacent creature you can touch for 4d6 hit points. This increases by 2d6 when you reach 15th level (6d6).

       - Reanimation: You provide life saving aid to a creature that has died within the last 10 minutes and return them to life. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This procedure can't return to life a creature that
                      has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. You cannot use this feature again until you have completed a short rest.
       - Experianced Healer: you are unlikely to fail at common medical tasks. Whenever you make a Medicine check you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
       - Sedate: you have managed to create sedatives using standard supplies. As an action you can inject a willing creature with a sedative that will cause them to go unconscious for 1d4 hours. You can also attempt to inject
                 an unwilling creature for the same effect. An unwilling target must be below one quarter of its maximum hit points for this ability to take effect. They must then succeed a Constitution saving throw or
                 immediately fall unconscious for 1d4 hours.
       - Practiced Hands: you have performed the same procedures countless times. Whenenever you use a healing ability, item, or other effect that involves a die roll you can add an additional healing die of the same type to the
                          end result, even if the result would otherwise be maximized.
       - Experimental Procedure: you recognize that the limitations of the mortal body are simply defects waiting to be corrected. You target a specific stat; Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
                                 and attempt to improve it. This may involve replacing organs, changing appearance, or altering brain chemistry. To be successful you must succeed on a DC25 Medicine check or the procedure fails.
                                 On a success the target gains a permanent +1 bonus to the targeted ability score. You may not attempt this procedure on the same target more than 3 times, regardless of success or failure. Due
                                 to your skills a failure does not inflict any negative effects on the target, but the target receives no benefits. The procedure takes eight hours from start to finish, and cannot be paused or
                                 interrupted. The targeted creature takes five days to recover, and remains incapacitated.
