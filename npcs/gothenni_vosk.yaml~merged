      They, like the others of their kind, were born whole-cloth from the Aether. They were trained as a thief and assassin for the previous crime lord and did his bidding until the day They were supposed to die. But Gothenni didn't want to die. Their will to live proved stronger than the nature of Their being and in Their final moment They absorbed the total life essence of their employer, extending Their life and ending his. From that point on, They took over as the new boss and continued to feed their Vampiric Hunger with anyone who crossed Them

# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills:
   - - Aetherborn Abilities:
       - Darkvision: can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray           
       - Born of Aether: You have resistance to necrotic damage
       - Menacing: You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill
       - Vampiric Gift: An aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability, which is a natural attack that uses Strength for its attack and damage rolls, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit
                        points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6 per week. This reduction canât be removed until the aetherborn
                        has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest                      
                                   
   - - Rogue Abilities:
       - Expertise: Double proficiency bonus with Thieve's Tools and Sleight of Hand
       - Sneak Attack: Once per turn can add 3d6 to one creature she hits with a ranged or finesse attack if she has advantage on the attack or if the target is engaged with another creater
       - Cunning Action: Can tak a bonus action on each turn to Hide, Disengage or Dash
       - Uncanny Dodge: When an attacker she can see hits her with an attack, she can use her Reaction to halve the damage 
       - Evasion: When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail
       - Reliable Talent: Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your Proficiency Bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
       - Blindsense: if you are able to hear, you are aware of the Location of any hidden or Invisible creature within 10 feet of you
       - Slippery Mind: You gain proficiency in Wisdom Saving Throws
       - Elusive: No Attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't Incapacitated
       - Stroke of Luck: If your Attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat The D20 roll as a 20

   - - Mastermind Abilities:
       - Master of Intrigue: you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice. Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns
                             and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language
       - Master of Tactics: you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than
                            5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you
       - Insightful Manipulators: if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if
                                  the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice; Intelligence score, Wisdom score, Charisma score, Class levels (if any)
                                  - At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.
       - Misdirection: you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use
                       your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.
       - Soul of Deciet: your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.
                         Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic

    background-story: |
      They, like the others of their kind, were born whole-cloth from the Aether. They were trained as a thief and assassin for the previous crime lord and did his bidding until the day They were supposed to die. But Gothenni
      didn't want to die. Their will to live proved stronger than the nature of Their being and in Their final moment They absorbed the total life essence of their employer, extending Their life and ending his. From that point
      on, They took over as the new boss and continued to feed their Vampiric Hunger with anyone who crossed Them
