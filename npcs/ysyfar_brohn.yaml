# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     A war erupted in the recent past in the Fhinnenqaal Range [expansive mountain range] between Mountain Dwarves and Drow battling for control over the myriad passages and veins of ore contained in the region. This war 
     disturbed more than the populations of Mountain Dwarves and Drow. Ongoing skirmishes spilled over into Tiefling villages nestled within the cave entrances to the Fhinnengal Range. Neither population were aware that these 
     Tieflings praised Kenaan [or another Tiefling God of Destruction], whose nihilistic followers only became more fervent in their belief that the destruction of the Realm is the only cure for the madness infecting the other 
     races and peoples. Ysyfar was born and raised in this culture and inculcated with their deep religious beliefs and rituals that centered on eradicating not just the peoples of the realm, but the realm itself. He gained 
     popularity among his people for his religious services that provided vicious and scathing diatribes condemning the other races. As the war spilled over into surrounding villages, Ysyfar proudly organized forces to defend 
     his people. This religious paramilitary group gradually grew into an offensive force and Ysyfar was granted leadership as Martial of Kenaan. With an entourage of soldiers of his order, this devoutly faithful warrior travels
     the region visiting temples of various deities to evaluate their role in the wars that characterize the races. He is very calculated in these 'visits', aware that he and his Order, while not well known, are not accepted 
     nor desired among the other communities of the region. Often found in deep prayer at the entrance to a temple or to a statuette of a deity acceptable to Kenaan, Ysyfar will rarely compromise his maleficent pilgrimage and 
     instead do everything possible to keep himself and his entourage appearing as peaceful pilgrims from a respectable Order.

    personality: |
     Ysyfar is bitter, decietful and bigoted. His indoctrinated hatred for all other races manifests in his quest for vengeance and to eradicate them from the word. His divine-fueled hatred has rallied his people around him. Not
     only does he excise his vengeance and rage upon other races, but other gods as well, destroying and defiling temples in his path if he beleives those gods deserve it. His devotion to Kenaan is above all, his driving 
     motivation in life.
