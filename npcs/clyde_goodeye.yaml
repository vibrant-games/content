    background-story: |
      <p><i>Darius DeManque's Glorius and Wondrous Traveling Show</i> was a well-known and loved troupe of traveling performers, freaks, musicians, and various purveyors of oddities. A runaway from an orphanage for boys, Clyde took his leave when the traveling show was passing through town, hiding amongst the crates and supplies for the curio shop.</p><p>Quickly becoming well-versed in the amazing oddities they had available, Clyde felt he found a new home and fit in nicely as the years passed. Unfortunately, the troupe and nearly all of their sets and goods were consumed by a flash grass fire while they camped. Clyde barely managed to escape on the smoking curio carriage; albeit badly burned, losing the use of an eye, and traumatized.</p><p>Doing his best at covering up the damages to the carriage and at keeping alive the spirit of the traveling troupe, Clyde Goodeye travels the countryside attempting to bring color and wonder to others while seeking more and more trinkets and curiosities for his stash.</p>
