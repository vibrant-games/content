# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Irini Dumas is the wife and half-sister of Nicodeamus Dumas and eldest grandaughter of Anastasia Dumas. She is Nicodeamus' second in command and the primary recruiter for the family.
      She is also the child of a union between Anastasia'a only daughter and the family's patron Devil. She is the high priestess of the family and helps her grandmother with all of the
      family rites and ceremonies dedicated to her father. She also has several children of her own with Nicodeamus most of whom have some degree of her devil heritage. In addition to that, she
      also has her /"children/", a group of lesser devils and minor undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, Scarecrows, poes, etc.). She is also responsible for recruiting initiates into the family,
      training new inductees and sacrificing those that don't make the cut.

    personality: |
      Irini Dumas is a drop dead gorgeous waife of a woman. Her pale, freckled face is silhouetted by long, flowing deep red hair. Her fine features are the kind that catch the attention of men and women alike.
      Tiny horns peak out from the top of her forehead, the only visable sign of her hellish heritage. Always dressed in long, flowing, black gowns, she always looks fantastic. Her weapon of choice is seduction
      and manipulation, and she is a master of both. Her beauty doesn't hurt at all, but her persuasive abilities and her magic skills, blessed by her father, make her a dangerous package. In addition to that,
      she is a zealot, masochist and full on psychopath. However, despite al of this, in her own way she is a devoted mother to her children and to her "Children". While she does her absolute best not to do her
      fighting herself, she will absolutely wade fully into battle to defend her children.
