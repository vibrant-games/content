    background-story: |
      <p>Raised in the remote Hill Dwarf lumber town of Gontor Rains [any Dwarven village], Babs was always the target of particularly lecherous laborers after their long days of work in the hillside forests and at the mill. Even as a young-un, she realized she had a knack for drawing the gaze of most peoples. A local smithy took a particular liking to her as she blossomed into her 'tween years and he would spend countless hours at his forge crafting a unique suit of Dwarven mail just for her.</p><p>Once completed, the smith gifted the mail to Babs with the hope that it would win her favor. Instead, it gained the interest of the males in the community who insisted that their small town enter Babs into chain-model contests in the nearby Dwarven city of Queldon [Any Dwarven City]. Needless to say, Babs' subconscious psionics began to mature as she drew the gaze of all kinds of traveling merchants and emissaries. Her career as a model began with a resounding, 'bang!'</p>
