    background-story: |
      <p>Trained from birth as a Knight and a Gish, Ham'za is a warrior of the highest degree. The combination of his martial and psi abilities make him an unstoppable killing machine, unless he loses interest in the fight. He is also a rebel among his people. </p><p>After living hundreds of years in the Astral Plane, he grew tired of the rigid militaristic ways of his people and escaped to the material plane to find new sources of entertainment.</p><p>Arrogant, aggressive and cruel, his favorite source of entertainment is battle and torture. He may briefly align himself with a party if he thinks their goals might be fun and keep him entertained for a while, but it's unlikely he'll remain on their side for long if there's not enough battle to keep his interest.  At which point, he'll probably just kill them and continue on his journey</p>
