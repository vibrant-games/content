    background-story: |
      <p>While there is little known about their origins, Ronn <i>appears</i> as a middle-aged adult human male. Yet there are numerous questions and myths that swirl throughout the realms as to their origins. See, Ronn is far too well-read and intelligent to be of mundane or mortal origins. They have accrued such a wealth of knowledge and capacity to teach others that most merchants, even nobles, covet their abilities and - especially - their satchel</p><p>Consequently, They have learned to ensure their own safety by enlisting the help of adventurers and mercenaries to protect them. Their guidelines for their protectors is to maintain distance as not to gain unwanted attention, to permit free movement, and to not scare off the inquisitive; whom they welcome with open arms.</p><p>Ronn has a serious wanderlust, rarely staying in one town, city, or village for more than a week or two to spread their love of knowledge and accumulate even greater wealth.</p><p>Asexual and, in fact, without any noticeable confirmation of biological sex, they request that others use a variety of always changing pronouns when addressing them.</p>
