# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Argur Dumas is one of the more prominent and revered of the Dumas family's seemingly endless pool of "cousins". Like most of the "cousins", no one in nor outside of the family (excepy maybe the family patron)
      really seems to know what his lineage nor his parentage are, but they are a cousin all the same. Argur spent his time growing up splitting his time between studies and book learning with the Dumas family and martial
      combat and tactic training with a clan of gnolls that have long been closely linked to the Dumas Family. With the help of his family connections, Argur has managed to rise through the ranks and is currently the ranking
      chief and battle commander of the gnoll clan, binding their loyatly to to the Dumas Family tighter than ever before.

      Argur Dumas is a brilliant and agressive military tactician. He is a smart, cunning opportunist, but also a coward. He has worked his way up through both the family and his pack with treachery and politicing more than
      bravery. He insures that his men will fight until their dying breath, but will cut and run before putting himself in any real harms way. He will, however, fight viciously with weapons, tooth and claw if left with no other
      choice. He is a remarkable tactician and capable of rethinking and executing plans as the fly to gain advantage in any situation.
