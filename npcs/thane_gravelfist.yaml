# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     Thane hails from the brewing town of Hemmelweist [Village/Town] in remote hills nestled within the vast mountain range of SimmeredAshes [Mountain Range]. His community were very kinship focused and taught him the value of
     offering hearth and home to those people among whom one lives. Cared for by multiple different members of this closeknit community, he gained a deep love for the 'commoner' - he or she that partakes in those daily
     activities that support a group and form its foundational infrastructure. He thusly also learned the various skillsets that complement such a vision: brewing, cooking, textile work. Creating fabulous rare brews of mountain
     apples and deephops or lush woven fabrics for bed linens and window dressings; these were the lively activities that colored his youth. However, these beautiful products were being created during a time when neighboring
     mountain Dwarven cities, such as Kindlebrough and Cynd [Dwarven cities], and various Human settlements in the Eastern Plains [Broad Settled Expanse] were suffering from hunger and poverty. This wondrous pallette of the best
     aspects of Dwarven culture was suddenly disrupted after a pact was struck upon between these two communities - a pact for mutual expansion. A collective response was required from Thane's tribe and an aristocracy quickly
     formed as the village leaders were overcome with panic and sudden greed. Quickly rising in power, this group condensed to a few self-appointed leaders. They became tyrants in a matter of months, enforcing impossible laws
     that led to austere and deprived conditions. Families were broken and scattered. Vowing to one day return and bring his people back to their glory, Thane fled for weeks searching for a civilization within which to begin his
     life anew and share the ethical codes of his people with the world at large. Thane's inborn work ethic gained traction with village markets and it wasn't long before he had accrued enough coin to begin planning to return to
     his people. His connections to the people with whom he resettled excite him at the potential that he will not return to his home alone.

    personality: |
     Thane is a bright young man with a big heart and a aversion to injustice. He is a hard worker and apllies that ethhic to making his patrons as comfortable as he possibly can. He intently observes local politics, though he
     has no political aspirations himself. He is keenly aware of political injustices and hopes to one day returm home and rid it of its problems.
