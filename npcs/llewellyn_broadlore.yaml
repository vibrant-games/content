# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills:
   - - Elf Abilities:
        - Fey Ancestry: Advantage on saving throws againts charm and immune to sleep magic
        - Darkvision: Can see 60 in dim light as though it was bright light and in darkness as if it was dim light
        - Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill 
        - Trance: Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
                  dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep
        - Elf Weapon Training: You have proficiency with the Longsword, Shortsword, Shortbow, and Longbow
                      
   - - Wizard Abilities:
         - Arcane Recovery: After a short rest can recover a spell slot up to 3rd level			  
         - Spellcasting: Spell DC 17 
            Cantrips: True Strike, Dancing Lights, Fire Bolt, Mage Hand, Mending
            1st Level: Comprehend Languages, Detect Magic, Gift of Alacrity, Find Familiar
            2nd Level: Augury, Detect Thoughts, Mind Spike
            3rd Level: Clairvoyance, Fireball, Tiny Servant
            4th Level: Divination, Private Sanctum, Dimension Door
            5th Level: Legend Lore, Scrying
       
   - - School of Divination Abilities:
       - Divination Savant: the gold and time you must spend to copy a Divination spell into your spellbook is halved.
       - Potent: when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw,
                 or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each
                 foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls
       - Expert Divination: casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain
                            one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level
       - The Third Eye:  you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can't
                         use the feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
                         - Darkvision: You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
                         - Ethereal Sight: You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.
                         - Greater Comprehension: You can read any language.
                         - See Invisibility: You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight

    background-story: |
      Llewellyn is a very old man, even by elf standards. He's spent much of his life travelling around the realms collecting books and studying lore. As he grew too old 
      for the life of an adventurer, he settled in the city and opened a store to display and pass on his huge collection. He is always interested in bringing in new 
      lore and historical volumes, and can become distracted and talk at lengths about history, lore and arcana. To him, knowledge is it's own reward. During his travels
      he has collected a number of magical tombs and scrolls which he keeps under lock and key at the shop. A player would have to heavily impress him to sell one of them though,
      and even then, they would be very expensive.
      
    #

    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.

    #
    personality: |
      Llewellyn is a knowledgeable man and well travelled. He prizes learning and knowledge above all else, and is always happy to share his extensive knowledge and learn a little more himself.
