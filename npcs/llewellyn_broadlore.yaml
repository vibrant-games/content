    background-story: |
      <p>Llewellyn is a very old man, even by elf standards. He's spent much of his life travelling around the realms collecting books and studying lore. As he grew too old 
      for the life of an adventurer, he settled in the city and opened a store to display and pass on his huge collection.</p><p>  He is always interested in bringing in new 
      lore and historical volumes, and can become distracted and talk at lengths about history, lore and arcana. To him, knowledge is it's own reward.</p><p> During his travels
      he has collected a number of magical tombs and scrolls which he keeps under lock and key at the shop. A player would have to heavily impress him to sell one of them though,
      and even then, they would be very expensive.</p>
