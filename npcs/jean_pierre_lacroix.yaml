    background-story: |
      <p>Jean-Pierre was raised in a service family. His father was a butler and his mother was a nanny. He grew up always wanting to be wealthy and looking down on the poor as well as many of what he considers "The Lesser Races" (basically any race that isn't human or elf).</p><p> As he was not wealthy despite his desperate desire to be, he went into service himself. As it turned out, he was very very good at it. He worked his way up through the restaurants around town eventually achieving the position of Maitre D at the most prestigious restaurant in the region.</p><p>He is extremely good at his job and very attentive to his highest priority guests. This serves two purposes for him; First it insures that he is tipped well and develops return customers, and secondly, it allows him to eavesdrop on his important guest, gather their secrets, and handsomely supplement his income by selling those secrets to the local thieve's guild where they can be put to good use by the underworld.</p>
