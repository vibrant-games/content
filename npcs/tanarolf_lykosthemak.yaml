    background-story: |
      Tanarolf loves his job. He works hard under the premise that he's keeping order and loyally doing his duty to his city and nation. But what he really loves is the feeling of power and control that it gives him and the opportunity to take out his naturally aggressive tendencies on his prisoners. He is a petty man with a quick temper, but he's also a bit of a coward when he's not in charge of the situation. Like most bullies, he will quickly back down and turn to self-preservation when presented with an actual threat. He is strong and a natural fighter but will run rather than fight if he thinks he's outmatched.
