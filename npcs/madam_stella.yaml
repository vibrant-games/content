# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Born to a salt miner mother and an accountant father, Stella grew up in a comfortably middle-class salt dwarf home with 4 brothers. Stella's mother instilled a solid sense of self-reliance and fearlessness toward male
      dwarves.  She fought hard and dirty as a child, quickly gaining reputations first as a dwarf girl not to be messed with, and later, as a bully to be feared. Along the way, though she rebelled against her father, running
      away from home on a number of occasions, she still acquired, through blood or through osmosis, his vigilance with money. Emerging from the salt mines fairly young for a dwarf, Stella worked numerous positions for
      several years: earning her keep as baker, chimney sweep, quartermaster, governess, and personal accountant to the wild son of a lesser member of gold dwarf nobility. Stella and the wild son of the noble dwarf eloped and
      were married in a kubernetic horizontal pod ceremony (which is unrecognized by dwarf law, though the noble family was oblivious to this fact in their outpouring of rage). The wild son's brothers chased Stella and the
      wild son from town to town for months, until they landed in a small inland port town, and the brothers lost the scent. Stella joined the local "seamstresses" to pay for her husband's wild ways. One day, drunk on
      cherry brandy, he shot her in the leg with a crossbow bolt. The local barber amputated Stella's leg.  Her clientele expanded rapidly, as word got out about "that crazy peg lady who will do anything you want" (including
      acts involving her peg leg). The wild son has not been seen since the day of Stella's amputation. Several years later, Stella opened her own house of "seamstresses" high on a hilltop surrounded by the homes of
      the wealthy and powerful.  As a seamstress, she has been in the pockets of most of the town's elite, including the constabulary who hound her continually for unpaid taxes. Stella's mansion on the hill is widely regarded
      to be the classiest brothel in town, and is of some repute even several towns down the road.  She keeps her ladies fit and gorgeous, and trains them in upper class etiquette, psychology and identifying peculiar fetishes.
      Though Stella is no longer active as a "seamstress" herself, she still hears every item of upper class news, gossip, and secrets that there is to hear.  Stella knows everything about just about every wealthy and/or noble
      man in town.  She is always happy to gossip, though she does also know the value of a thing, and she knows when to charge, and how much to charge.

    personality: |
      Stella is tough and wiley, but keeps herself looking good and feeling good. Shes smart and wise with money and business. She also has a bit of a wild side and can come off as brash and cantankerous, especially when
      dealing with the law
