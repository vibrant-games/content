# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. The wearer can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against the wearer’s will. It detaches if the 
               wearer dies.
    - title: Battlefist
    - content: At 3rd level you replace one of your arms with a battlefist, a magical prosthetic you created. Your battlefist is a simple melee weapon, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. While 
               your battlefist is a magical weapon, it can be infused as if it were a nonmagical weapon.
               When you attack with your battlefist, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the attack roll. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength or Intelligence 
               modifier. At 9th level, the damage dealt by your battlefist increases to 2d10 + your Strength or Intelligence modifier.
               Additionally, you can choose one of the following weapon properties to add to your battlefist - finesse, thrown (range 20/60), or reach. When you finish a long rest, you can replace this property with a different
               weapon property from the list.
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: At 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Improved Battlefist
    - content: At 9th level, you have modified your battlefist in both mundane and magical ways. It gains the following benefits
               When you infuse your battlefist, you can apply two infusions to it at a time. If both infusions grant bonuses to your attack rolls or armor class, you gain only the greater bonus.
               Your battlefist is also a shield, increasing your armor class by 2. You can wield it as a weapon even if you are using it as a shield. You can infuse it as if it were both a simple melee weapon and a shield.
               The maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 1, but the extra infusion must be applied to your battlefist.

               can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Slayers Prey
    - content: You can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each 
               turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different 
               creature.
    - title: Supernatural Defense
    - content: You gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to

    background-story: |
      Thadeus Periwinkle came by his biological research in the most unfortunate fashion. Growing up as a monster hunter and tracker, his party were tracking a den of Trolls that had been terrorizing local villages. 
      The party was taken by surprise and Thadeus was the only survivor. When he was found by travellers, he had lost his left arm and left leg and a good sized chunk of the flesh from his chest. He was healed and 
      revived but what was gone was gone. In his search to rebuild his body, he stumbled across the lore of artifice and began to study its skills and processes. After learning some of the secrets, he began to rebuild 
      his broken body from steel and magic. He has given himself a mechanical arm, leg and armored the missing parts of his chest. Because of his skill in developing mechanized prostectics and his studies into biology, 
      Thadeus was recruited into the Collegium by Oswald Vardklemp where he has continued develop his research where he came to work closely with Ulther Hapwath and Dr. Andreas Stormhollow

    personality: |
      Thadeus Periwinkle is a tall and thin Half-Elf. He has short, blonde hair and pointed ears and scars on his face. He almost always wears a long trenchcoat or lab coat to cover the mechanized components of his body. 
      Considereing his trauma and the fact that he is almost constantly in pain, he is generally pleasant and personable. He has long ago accepted that he's never getting his body back, but has been methodical and devoted 
      in continuing to upgrade his prostectics. His devotion to his work and knowledge of upgrading humanoid forms has led him to work closely and become fast friends with Ulther Hapwath as they pursue their goals together.
      Thadeus and Ulther are also the only two members of the Collegium who are still in contact with their estranged colleague, Dr. Andreas Stormhollow.
