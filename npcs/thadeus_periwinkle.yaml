# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Thadeus Periwinkle came by his biological research in the most unfortunate fashion. Growing up as a monster hunter and tracker, his party were tracking a den of Trolls that had been terrorizing local villages. 
      The party was taken by surprise and Thadeus was the only survivor. When he was found by travellers, he had lost his left arm and left leg and a good sized chunk of the flesh from his chest. He was healed and 
      revived but what was gone was gone. In his search to rebuild his body, he stumbled across the lore of artifice and began to study its skills and processes. After learning some of the secrets, he began to rebuild 
      his broken body from steel and magic. He has given himself a mechanical arm, leg and armored the missing parts of his chest. Because of his skill in developing mechanized prostectics and his studies into biology, 
      Thadeus was recruited into the Collegium by Oswald Vardklemp where he has continued develop his research

    personality: |
      Thadeus Periwinkle is a tall and thin Half-Elf. He has short, blonde hair and pointed ears and scars on his face. He almost always wears a long trenchcoat or lab coat to cover the mechanized components of his body. 
      Considereing his trauma and the fact that he is almost constantly in pain, he is generally pleasant and personable. He has long ago accepted that he's never getting his body back, but has been methodical and devoted 
      in continuing to upgrade his prostectics. His devotion to his work and knowledge of upgrading humanoid forms has led him to work closely and become fast friends with Ulther Hapwath as they pursue their goals together.
