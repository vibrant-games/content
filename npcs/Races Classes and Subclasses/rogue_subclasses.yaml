    - title: Psionic Talent
    - content: You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of 
               which is a d6.
    - title: Psionic Talent Options
    - content: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways -
               Psi-Bolstered Knack - When your non-psionic training fails you, you can tap into your psionic power to help; if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you 
                                     can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success.
               Psychic Whispers - You can use your psychic abilities to establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, you give yourself and at least one
                                  other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal
                                  to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action 
                                  required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can’t use this telepathy if it can’t speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic
                                  connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don’t need to speak a common language to understand each other.
               Changing the Die’s Size - If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example,
                                         if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your 
                                         Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you 
                                         roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this 
                                         class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases - at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
               Psi Replenishment - As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Psychic Blades
    - content: You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. When you are about to make a melee or ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free 
               hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals 
               psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals 
               damage. After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The 
               damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.
    - title: Psionic Enhancement
    - content: You can focus your psionic power to give yourself an extraordinary ability. When you finish a long rest, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until you finish a long rest 
               You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If a creature can speak at least one language, it can respond to you telepathically.
               Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.
               Your hit point maximum and your current hit points increase by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your rogue level.
    - title: Soul Blades
    - content: Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you finer control over them in the following ways - 
               Homing Strikes - If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, 
                                your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size, regardless of the number rolled.
               Psychic Teleportation - If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can hurl your Psychic Blades to magically transport yourself to another location. As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic
                                       Blades and throw it at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 5 times the highest number on your Psionic Talent die. You then teleport to that space,
                                       the blade vanishes, and your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size.
               Terrifying Blade - When you damage a creature with your Psychic Blade, you can force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). On a 
                                  failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature isn’t frightened and is immune to your Terrifying Blade for 24 hours.
    - title: Psionic Veil
    - content: You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 10 minutes or until you dismiss this effect 
               (no action required). This invisibility ends if you deal damage to a creature or if you force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long 
               rest, unless you decrease your Psionic Talent die by one die size to use this feature again.
    - title: Rend Mind
    - content: You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through a creature’s mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 
               equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). Unless the save succeeds, the target is stunned until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you 
               finish a long rest, unless you decrease your Psionic Talent die by one die size to use this feature again

               trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you

               than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart. If you succeed on the check and the
               creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

               must increase the misfire score by +4 for each additional damage die.
    - title: Sniper

    - title: Eyes and Ears of the Undercity
    - content: You can spend your action to borrow the senses of nearby vermin, such as rats or cockroaches. While using the ability, you can’t see or hear anything with your own eyes and ears, but you 
               can perceive what any of these creatures within 30 feet does. The ability lasts for up to 10 minutes, or until you end it voluntarily. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again 
               until you finish a short or long rest.
    - title: Scavenge
    - content: You can consume the remains of a nearby carcass to heal. You transform part of your body into a swarm of scavenging insects to feast on the body. As a bonus action, if the body of a recently slain creature is 
               within 10 ft., you can spend a hit die and regain as many hit points, plus a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the slain creature.
    - title: Become the Swarm
    - contentt: You can use your action to assume the shape of a swarm of rodents or insects. After you use this feature, you can use it again after a short or long rest. Your rogue level determines the type of swarm 
                you can transform into, as shown in the Swarm Shapes table. At 9th level, for example, you can transform into any swarm that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower.
                Swarm Shapes
                Level   Max CR   Example
                9th	     1/4	 Swarm of bats, rats or ravens
                12th     1/2     Swarm of insects
                15th     1       Swarm of quippers
                18th     2       Swarm of poisonous snakes
                You can stay in a swarm shape for a number of hours equal to half your rogue level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus 
                action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, 
                personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. When you transform, you 
                assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping 
                to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. See the druid’s 
                wild shape feature for additional rules that apply while you are transformed into a swarm of small critters.

    - title: Walking Hive

               you. At the start of each of your turns, non-friendly creatures adjacent to you automatically take 3d6 poison damage.
