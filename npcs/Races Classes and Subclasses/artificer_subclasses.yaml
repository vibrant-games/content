    - title: Experimental Elixir
    - content: whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when 
               someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature. You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 
               1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table. 
               Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest. 
               When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest; two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir 
               requires its own flask.

    - title: Alchemical Savant
    - content: You've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, 
               you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier 
               (minimum of +1). 
    - title: Restorative Reagents
    - content: You can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works
               Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
               You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times 
               equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Chemical Mastery
    - content: You have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments
               You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.
               You can cast Greater Restoration and Heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the 
               spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

               You gain proficiency with martial weapons.

    - title: Steel Defender
    - content: Your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which
               uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics. In combat, the defender
               shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a 
               bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, 
               not just Dodge. If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 
               feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel 
               defender if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

    - title: Arcane Jolt
    - content: You've learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the 
               strike to create one of the following effects
               The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
               Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

               choice.
    - title: Arcane Armor
    - contnet: Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand. 
               You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor;
               If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
               You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
               The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any 
               missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
               The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.
    - title: Armor Model
    - content: You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models; Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it. Each model includes
               a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. You can change the armor's model whenever you 
               finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.
    - title: Guardian
    - content: You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features
    - title: Thunder Gauntlets
    - content: Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has 
               disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.
    - title: Defensive Field
    - content: As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you 
               doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Infiltrator
    - content: You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features;
               Lightning Launcher - A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, 
                                    and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.
               Powered Steps - Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
               Dampening Field - You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.  
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Armor Modifications
    - content: You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature; armor (the chest piece), 
               boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's model with the Armor Model feature. In 
               addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.
    - title: Perfected Armor
    - content: Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.
               Guardian - When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell 
                          save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of 
                          this reaction. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
               Infiltrator - Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot 
                             radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, 
                             the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

    - title: Tool Proficiency
    - contnet: You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice
    - title: Eldritch Cannon
    - content: You've learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a 
               horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest
               or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present. The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon 
               has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat 
               all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action. 
               When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you 
               can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space,
               provided it has legs.
    - content: Flamethrower - The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage
                              on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
    - content: Force Ballista-  Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, 
                                it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.
    - content: Protector - The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence 
                           modifier (minimum of +1).           
    - title: Arcane Firearm
    - content: You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, 
               staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely. You can use your 
               arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the 
               number rolled.
    - title: Explosive Cannon
    - content: every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive
    - content: The cannon's damage rolls all increase by 1d8.
    - content: As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw 
               against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
    - title: Fortified Position
    - content: you’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannon
    - content: You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.
    - content: You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine 
               whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.

    - title: Spellbinding Thread
    - content: You learn to store threads of magic in your mantle's patterns. At the end of a long rest, you can weave a 1st Level Artificer Spell with a casting time of 1 Action or less into your mantle. You can cast this spell

    - title: Intercepting Cloak
    - content: You further enhance your mantle's capabilities, allowing it to deflect incoming blows. When an attacker hits you with an attack, your cloak can intercept the blow. Once per turn you can reduce the damage of that

    - title: Battle Ready
    - content: Beginning at 3rd level, you’re skilled in fighting side-by-side with your companions on the field of battle. You gain proficiency with martial weapons. Additionally, when you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
    - title: Ghall'Shaarat
    - content: At 3rd level, you learn to imbue a weapon with a fraction of your spirit. The Dhakaani daashors called this weapon the ghaal’shaarat, Goblin for “mighty blade.” Imbuing your ghaal’shaarat works like infusing an 
               item, but does not count toward your maximum number of infused items. When you finish a long rest, you can touch a magic or nonmagical simple or martial melee weapon, which becomes your ghaal’shaarat.
               Once imbued, your ghaal’shaarat is a magic weapon that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless the base weapon you imbued already grants a higher bonus. This bonus increases when you reach certain 
               levels in this class, increasing to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 13th level. If the weapon you imbued has the thrown property, it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
               Your ghaal’shaarat’s benefits remain until the weapon is destroyed or until you use this ability to imbue a new item with this power. Other creatures can’t benefit from your ghaal’shaarat’s powers, and to them, it
               functions as the unimbued weapon did.
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Runes of War
    - content: At 9th level, you gain the ability to enhance the weapons of your squad, targeting the damage to the weakness of your enemies. As an action, you can activate an aura that extends from you in a 30-foot radius. The 
               aura moves with you, centered on you, and lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were casting a spell).
               When you activate this aura, choose one of the following damage types - acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Each creature of your choice in the aura deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits 
               with a weapon attack.
               You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.
    - title: Perfect Weapon
    - content: At 15th level, you learn how to imbue your ghaal’shaarat with additional power, and how to draw on it in time of need. The first time you attack with your ghaal’shaarat on your turn, you can transfer some or all 
               of its bonus to your armor class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For every 1 you reduce your attack and damage rolls by, you gain +1 to your AC. As long as you continue holding your 
               ghaal’shaarat, the AC bonus remains in effect until the start of your next turn.
               Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can select one of the following benefits. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain the selected benefit whenever you’re holding your ghaal’shaarat.
               You have resistance to psychic damage, and you can’t be charmed or frightened.
               You use your ghaal’shaarat to channel the elements. When you select this ability, select one of the following damage types - acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you hit with your ghaal’shaarat, the 
               target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type.

    - title: Tools of Integration
    - content: At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith’s tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.
    - title: Prosthesis Expertise
    - content: At 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with your power, creating a permanent magical item that replaces a lost limb—a hand, arm, foot, leg, or similar body 
               part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. The wearer can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against the wearer’s will. It detaches if the 
               wearer dies.
    - title: Battlefist
    - content: At 3rd level you replace one of your arms with a battlefist, a magical prosthetic you created. Your battlefist is a simple melee weapon, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. While 
               your battlefist is a magical weapon, it can be infused as if it were a nonmagical weapon.
               When you attack with your battlefist, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the attack roll. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength or Intelligence 
               modifier. At 9th level, the damage dealt by your battlefist increases to 2d10 + your Strength or Intelligence modifier.
               Additionally, you can choose one of the following weapon properties to add to your battlefist - finesse, thrown (range 20/60), or reach. When you finish a long rest, you can replace this property with a different
               weapon property from the list.
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: At 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Improved Battlefist
    - content: At 9th level, you have modified your battlefist in both mundane and magical ways. It gains the following benefits
               When you infuse your battlefist, you can apply two infusions to it at a time. If both infusions grant bonuses to your attack rolls or armor class, you gain only the greater bonus.
               Your battlefist is also a shield, increasing your armor class by 2. You can wield it as a weapon even if you are using it as a shield. You can infuse it as if it were both a simple melee weapon and a shield.
               The maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 1, but the extra infusion must be applied to your battlefist.
    - title: Construct Apotheosis
    - content: At 15th level you have modified your form, becoming nearly impervious to the weaknesses of flesh. You gain the following benefits
               You gain resistance to poison damage and psychic damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.
               If you are affected by a spell or magical effect, you can choose to consider yourself a construct instead of your other creature types.
               You can cast the Antilife Shell and Investiture of Stone spells without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use your battlefist as the spellcasting 
               focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.
               
               
  - title: Maverick Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Arcane Breakthroughs
    - content: Starting at 3rd level, you gain amazing insights into spell effects beyond the reach of most artificers. Choose one of the following classes - bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. 
               This class’s spells become part of your Breakthrough spell list. You can choose an additional class and add its spells to your Breakthrough spell list at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
               When you change your list of prepared artificer spells after a long rest, you can prepare an additional 1st-level spell. This spell must be from your Breakthrough spell list. When you reach certain levels in this 
               class, you increase the number of Breakthrough spells that you can prepare. You can prepare an additional 2nd-level spell at 5th level, an additional 3rd-level spell at 9th level, an additional 4th-level spell at 
               13th level, and an additional 5th-level spell at 17th level. These prepared spells don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.
               When you cast a spell you’ve prepared using this feature, it’s considered to be an artificer spell for you, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. When you swap a prepared Breakthrough spell for a 
               new spell, you lose any ongoing benefits from having cast it (such as a steed summoned by find steed).
    - title: Cantrip Specialist
    - content: You excel at producing minor magical effects—and at abandoning your current projects to pursue new ideas. Starting at 3rd level you gain the following benefits
               You know one additional cantrip beyond what’s normally allowed for an artificer of your level.
               When you finish a short rest (instead of when you gain a level in this class), you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list or your Breakthrough spell 
               list. This cantrip is considered an artificer cantrip for you.
    - title: Cantrip Savant
    - content: Starting at 5th level, you continue to develop your talent for the simplest spells. You gain the following benefits
               When casting an artificer cantrip, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and to your artificer spell save DC unless your spellcasting focus grants a higher bonus. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels 
               in this class, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 15th level.
               As an action, you can replace an artificer cantrip you know with a different cantrip from the artificer spell list or your Breakthrough spell list. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you 
               finish a long rest.
    - title: Superior Breakthoughs
    - content: Starting at 9th level, when you cast one of the spells you prepared with Arcane Breakthroughs, you can do so as if the spell was cast using a spell slot two levels higher than the spell slot you expend.
               You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest.
    - title: Work in Progress
    - content: Starting at 9th level, you can ready half-formed projects for easy completion when needed. As an action, you can replace any prepared artificer spell with any other spell from the artificer spell list, which then 
               counts as a prepared spell for you.
               Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.
    - title: Final Breakthrough
    - content: At 15th level, you gain one additional spell slot of each spell level you can prepare. These spell slots can only be used to cast the bonus spells granted by your Arcane Breakthroughs. As you gain levels in this 
               class and are able to prepare 5th-level artificer spells, you gain an additional spell slot of that level.

    - title: Tools of the Trade
    - content: By the time you adopt this specialty at 3rd level,you’re deeply familiar with employing its tools.
               Proficiencies - You gain proficiency with calligrapher’s supplies and the forgery kit, assuming you don’t already have them. You also gain calligrapher’s supplies and a forgery kit for free—the result of tinkering
               you’ve done as you’ve prepared for this specialization.
               Crafting - If you craft a magic item in the scroll category, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.
    - title: Artificial Mind
    - content: At 3rd level, you discover how to awaken a mind inside an object. Whenever you finish a long rest and your calligrapher’s supplies are with you, you can magically rouse a keen mind within a Tiny, nonmagical object
               on which you write mystical symbols. The object is a magic item while the mind is inside it, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. If you already have an artificial mind from this feature, the first one 
               immediately dissipates.
    - content: The magic item has the following properties
    - content: Telepathic Advisor - The artificial mind telepathically supplies you with advice and information about certain topics - while the item is on your person, you have proficiency in two skills of your choice; the 
                                    item’s main material determines which skills you can choose from, as shown on the Artificial Mind table in the Skill Proficiencies column, for the nature of the object affects the mind’s 
                                    knowledge.
    - content: Manifest Mind - As a bonus action while the item is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral presence, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This 
                               presence is intangible and invulnerable, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You determine its appearance; the Artificial Mind table offers suggested appearances based on the object’s main 
                               material. While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. As an action, you can hear and see using the mind’s senses, instead of your own, until
                               your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
                               As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops 
                               manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from its magic item or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.
                               When you cast an artificer spell on your turn,you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind’s space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to 
                               your Intelligence modifier (at least once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    - content: Information Overload - As an action while the item is on your person, you can try to magically overload the thoughts of one creature you or the mind can see that is within 5 feet of the manifested mind, channeling
                                      a jumble of information from the artificial mind. Unless the target succeeds on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the next 
                                      attack roll against it before the end of your next turn has advantage, since it is temporarily too distracted to defend itself well. The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level 
                                      (2d8), 11th level(3d8), and 17th level (4d8) in this class. Whenever you deal damage with this feature,you can expend a spell slot to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage is 
                                      2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than first.

    - title: Mind Network
    - content: At 6th level, you’ve learned how to use your artifices to access minds, both to communicate and to harm.
    - content: Magical Telephony - While you have your Artificial Mind item on your person, you can communicate telepathically with anyone carrying an item bearing one of your artificer infusions, as the mind transmits your 
                                   thoughts to each other. That person can also communicate telepathically with you as long as they have the item. This two-way communication can even cross planar boundaries.
    - content: Psychic Damage. When you make a psychic damage roll for an artificer spell or for Information Overload, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to your Intelligence modifier(minimum bonus of +1)
    - title: Pure Information
    - content: At 14th level, your Artificial Mind is able to receive and transmit more information than ever before.
    - content: Mind Overload - When you expend a spell slot to increase the damage of Information Overload, the target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or be stunned until the end of your 
                               next turn.
    - content: Infoportation - As an action while your Artificial Mind magic item is on your person, you cause the mind to turn you into pure information, teleporting you to the unoccupied space nearest to the spectral mind or 
                               to an item bearing one of your artificer infusions, where you physically reappear.
    - content: You can teleport in this way once for free and must finish a long rest before doing so again. You can also use this special ability by expending a spell slot of 2nd level or higher.
