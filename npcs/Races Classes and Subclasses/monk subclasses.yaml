                                          points plus 1). The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is

               need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque. You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage

               that creature. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. In addition, you learn the following attributes about the target; Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities,

               them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie and all Charisma checks directed at the creature are made with advantage for up to 10 minutes. You 
               know if they succeeded or failed on their saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can
               be evasive in its answers as long as the effect lasts.

    - title: Ki Surge

               apply the effect corresponding to the number you roll. Some effects won't be able to be achieved until your martial arts die increases. Your save DC for these effects is equal to your Ki save DC. U you are 
               using unarmed strikes, your fists are your weapon for any effect the table describes that includes a weapon. The Ki Surge Table is shown on the following page.
               Ki Surge Table

                                    (regardless of whether it hits) and can roll an extra martial arts die with each of your damage rolls. This damage is also necrotic.
                      2             Weeds and Clovers - Vines and flowers sprout up around you in a radius of 20 feet. This area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.
                      3             Three Legs at Night - Your size increases by 1 size category for until the end of your next turn on your first strike, the size of the creature you strike decreases by 1 size category 
                                    (given it is not tiny). After the minute ends, you gain 1 point of exhaustion. 
                      4             Improvised Solo - Your piercing kihaps become infused with a melodic tone. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain a d8 bardic inspiration die
                                    for 1 minute. After your attack, you lose your voice and can only whisper until you take a long rest or are healed by a lesser restoration or higher.

                      6             Master of Elements - Elemental energy shoots out of your body. Four elements (water, earth, air, fire) swirl around you, forming a protective layer of energy until the end of your next 
                                    turn. While this is up, you have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, cold, thunder, and fire damage.
                      7             Winging it - You unfurl a pair of spectral wings and have a flying speed of 40 ft. until the end of your next turn.
                      8             Rapidly Expanding Universe - An astral double of your monk weapon appears that lasts until the end of your next turn. With this astral weapon, you have a melee range of 30 ft.
                      9             Seeing Double - An illusory duplicate of yourself appears in your space. For 1 minute, the duplicate moves with you and mimics your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track 
                                    which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates. Each time a creature targets you with an attack while the duplicate is up, roll a d20 to determine whether
                                    the attack instead targets one of your duplicate. You must roll a 11 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate.  A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an

                                    spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
                      10            Life in Death - Your monk weapon glows with radiant energy on one side, and darkens in necrotic energy on the other. These effects fade at the end of your turn. You can choose which side 
                                    to attack with. If struck with the radiant side, a creature takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage and glows until the end of your next turn. While glowing, attacks against the creature have 
                                    advantage. If struck with the necrotic side, the creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage and must save on a constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
    - title: Ki Restoration
    - content: You gain the ability to convert k.i energy into life force. As an action you can use No Aether's Ki Conversion. This allows you to expend ki points to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your 
               wisdom modifier (minimum 1) per ki point you use. You can use a number of k.i points equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum 1) in tbis way per long rest. The temporary hit points last until you take a 
               long rest.
    - title: Taming Chaos
    - content: You begin to gain control of your ki surges. Whenever you roll on the Ki Surge table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, 
               you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table. Additionally, after finding out the outcome of the ki surge, you can use your bonus action to expend double the amount of ki points to extend 
               the duration of the effect by one increment. If the effect lasts one round, you can use an additional two k.i points to make it last another, and four more to make it last three rounds.
    - title: Greater Ki Surge
    - content: Your ki surges maximize in power. You can spend 3 k.i points to roll a dlO on the Greater Ki Surge Table at the start of your turn. You can do this once per long rest. lf the effect requires a saving 
               throw, your save DC for these effects is (8 +your proficiency bonus+ wis modifier). lf you are using unarmed strikes, your fists are your weapon for any effect the table describes that includes a 
               weapon.
               Greater Ki Surge Table
               Martial Arts Die     Effect
                      1             Make a wisdom saving throw against your own DC. If you fail, you polymorph into a baboon until the end of your next turn.
                      2             Your ki compresses the mass of the air around you. You manifest a well of gravitational energy in a circle with you at its center that has a radius of 30 ft. Each creature in the 
                                    circle must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This effect ends at the end of your turn.
                      3             Your ki converts to thermal energy and begins to physically heat up your skin. For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another 
                                    creature bursts into flame. 
                      4             A burst of energy from inside you disperses and settles into mist on the ground in a 100ft radius around you. The terrain around you begins to warp into another of your choosing. 
                                    The terrain's general shape remains the same. Open fields or a road could turn into a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to 
                                    seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Similarly, you can alter structures, or add them where none are 
                                    present. This warping includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement 
                                    through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the area disappears immediately.
                      5             You use your ki to harness the power of luck, and a glowing 15 ft radius circle appears with you at it’s center for 1 minute. The energy at the circumference of the circle swirls, 
                                    pulling the strings of fate. The circle has a line through its center, but you decide at what angle. Divided by this diameter, every creature in one half of the circle gains 
                                    advantage on attack rolls and saving throws, every creature in the other half has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws for the duration of the effect. Creatures are 
                                    unaware of this effect though they can see the circle. The circle moves with you and you can change the once per turn. You are unaffected by this luck displacement.
                      6             In fighting your opponent, you can sense the ki of your opponent, extract crucial information about your foe, granting you insight about their combat ability. Whenever you hit a 
                                    creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you mark them as analyzed. In addition, you learn the following attributes about the target; Damage 
                                    Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, and Condition Immunities.
                      7             Your next strike creates ripples through the ground and causes up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a 
                                    cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a 
                                    creature if that creature is Medium or smaller and one must appear under you. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, 
                                    which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to 
                                    clear by hand. If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. 
                                    If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched 
                                    between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against your save DC. On a success, 
                                    the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.
                      8             Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. For 1 minute, you can use your bonus action to teleport again this way. 
                                    After the minute is up, no matter how far you are, as long as you are on the same plane of existence, you immediately return to the exact location you were when you teleported the
                                    first time.
                      9             Energy begins to compress and gather around you, creating crackling lighting.  The next time you hit a creature, a bolt of lightning arcs toward your target. Three bolts then leap
                                    from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only 
                                    one of the bolts. A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
                      10            A swirling, black and purple vortex gathers at the end of your weapon, sucking the life energy from the nearest source. The next time you hit an opponent, the target must make a 
                                    Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If
                                    the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. You also gain temporary hit points equal to the 
                                    amount the target’s maximum was reduced by. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes. This vortex 
                                    disappears after the first strike that hits.
