    - Psionic Soul Abilities:
       - Psionic Talent: You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of 
                         which is a d6.
       - Psionic Talent Options: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways -
         Psionic Discovery: You can unlock the ability to cast a mind-oriented sorcerer spell you don’t already know. After meditating for 10 minutes (which can be done during a rest), roll your Psionic 
                            Talent die, and choose a sorcerer spell of a level for which you have spell slots and that is in the school of divination or enchantment. You know the chosen spell for a number of 
                            hours equal to the number you rolled.
         Psychic Sorcery: When you cast a spell, you can use your mind to form it, rather than relying on words, gestures, and materials. To do so, roll your Psionic Talent die. The spell then requires no 
                          verbal component, and if you rolled the level of the spell or higher, the spell doesn’t require somatic or material components either
         Telepathic Speech: You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see, and roll your Psionic Talent die. For a number
                            of hours equal to the number you rolled, you and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other 
                            equal to the number you rolled. To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows. The telepathic connection ends early if you use this ability
                            to form a connection with a different creature.
         Changing the Die’s Size: If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example,
                                  if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your 
                                  Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you 
                                  roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this 
                                  class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases - at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
         Psi Replenishment: As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long
                            rest.
       - Psychic Strike: You have learned to channel additional psychic energy into your spells. Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with a sorcerer spell for which you expend a spell slot, you can roll your Psionic 
                         Talent die and also deal psychic damage to that creature equal to the number rolled. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
       - Mind Over Body: You can now use the psi that flows through you to give your body extraordinary abilities. As a bonus action, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform
                         yourself for a number of hours equal to the number rolled. Until the transformation ends, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice for each sorcery point you spent, choosing a different 
                         benefit for each point;
                         - You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn’t behind total cover.
                         - You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover.
                         - You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
                         - Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape 
                           from nonmagical restraints or being grappled. 
       - Psychic Aura: If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can unleash your psionic power in a crackling aura of psychic energy; as a bonus action, you can magically radiate this transparent, 30-footradius aura for 1 
                       minute or until you’re incapacitated or lose the use of your Psionic Talent die. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the aura or moves into it for the first time on a turn, you can roll your Psionic 
                       Talent die and deal psychic damage to the creature, equaling the number rolled plus your Charisma modifier. If the creature takes any of this damage, its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.
  
  
                     
    - Aberrant Mind Abilities:
       - Invasive Thoughts: you gain the ability to use a bonus action to magically create a telepathic link with one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the link ends, you can telepathically speak to the target 
                            through the link, and if it understands at least one language, it can speak telepathically to you. The link lasts for 10 minutes, and it ends early if you are incapacitated or die, or if you use 
                            another bonus action to break the link or to establish this link with a different creature.
       - Aberrant Mind Spells:
         1st: Arms of Hadar, Dissonant Whispers
         3rd: Calm Emotions, Detect Thoughts
         5th: Hunger of Hadar, Sending
         7th: Compulsion, Evard’s Black Tentacles
         9th: Modify Memory, Rary’s Telepathic Bond
       - Warped Being: your aberrant origin protects you from harm. Your body might have a coating of viscous slime, tough hide, scales, or an invisible psionic barrier (choose the form of protection when you gain this feature).
                       Whatever form the protection takes, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren’t wearing armor.
       - Psionic Sorcery: when you cast any of the spells gained from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level. If you 
                          cast the spell using sorcery points, it requires no components.
       - Psychic Defenses: you gain resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
       - Revelation in Flesh: you can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within your flesh. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for 1 minute. For each sorcery point you spend,
                              you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends - 
                              - You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to breathe water. Gills grow from your neck or fan out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, or you grow lashing 
                                cilia that extend through your clothing.
                              - You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus.
                              - Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of 
                                movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
                              - Your eyes turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils. You are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 60 feet of you.
       - Warp Reality: you become the focal point of a reality-warping anomaly. As an action, you can magically radiate a transparent, 20-foot-radius aura for 1 minute. This might take the form of a sphere of rippling psychic 
                       energy, a fluctuating amoebic gel, an extrusion of ephemeral parasites, or some other manifestation. Other creatures treat the aura as difficult terrain, and when they start their turn in it, they take 
                       2d10 psychic damage. When you activate this feature, you can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the aura. As a bonus action, you can end the aura early. If you do so, you and 
                       any number of creatures you choose within the aura are teleported to a location you can see within 1 mile of you. Each creature must appear within 20 feet of you and in an unoccupied space. An unwilling 
                       creature that succeeds on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC is not teleported. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
              
              
                       
    - Clockwork Soul Abilities:
       - Restore Balance: your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can 
                          use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when
                          you finish a long rest.
       - Clockwork Soul Spells:
         1st: Alarm, Protection from Evil and Good
         3rd: Aid, Lesser Restoration
         5th: Dispel Magic, Protection from Energy
         7th: Freedom of Movement, Summon Construct
         9th: Greater Restoration, Wall of Force
       - Bastion of Law: you can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points to create a magical ward around yourself or 
                         another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this feature again. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of 
                         sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.
       - Trance of Order: you gain the ability to align your consciousness to the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can't 
                          benefit from advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it
                          again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.
       - Clokwork Cavalcade: you summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other constructs of your 
                             choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the following effects within the cube before vanishing;
                             - The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the cube.
                             - Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are repaired instantly.
                             - Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the cube.
                             Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.
 
 
 
    - Shadow Magic Abilities: 
       - Eyes of the Dark: you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet. When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the Darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you 
                           can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.
       - Strength of the Grave: When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are 
                                reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit. After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
       - Hound of Ill Omen: you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can 
                            see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics, with the following changes - 
                            - The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
                            - It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
                            - It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
                            - At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.
                            The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it 
                            can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has 
                            disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.
       - Shadow Walk: you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim 
                      light or darkness.
       - Umbral Form: you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other 
                      creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you 
                      die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action
                       
                       
                       
    - Storm Sorcery Abilities:
       - Wind Speaker: The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects; 
                       Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.
       - Tempestuous Magic: you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to 
                            fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks
       - Heart of the Storm: you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This 
                             eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.
       - Storm Guide: you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you. If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect 
                      as a bonus action. If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the 
                      end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.
       - Storms Fury: when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against 
                      your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.
       - Wind Soul: you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage. You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within
                    30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can't do so again until you 
                    finish a short or long rest.
                    
                    
                    
    - Wild Magic Abilities:
       - Wild Magic Surge: your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge 
                           table to create a random magical effect. The Wild Magic Surge table can be found in the Player's Handbook 
       - Tides of Chaos: you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
                         Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of 
                         this feature.
       - Bend Luck: you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to 
                    roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.
       - Controlled Chaos: you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.
       - Spell Bombardment: the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to 
                            the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.
                            
                            
                            
    - Divine Soul Abilities:
       - Divine Magic: Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, 
                       you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. In 
                       addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power; good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you
                       but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.
                       Affinity    Spell
                       Good        Cure Wounds
                       Evil        Inflict Wounds
                       Law         Bless
                       Chaos       Bane
                       Neutrality  Protection from Evil and Good
       - Favored by the Gods: divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you 
                              can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Empowered Healing: the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 
                            sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.
       - Angelic Form: you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you 
                       dismiss them as a bonus action. The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings; eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly
                       wings for neutrality.
       - Unearthly Recovery: you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point 
                             maximum. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
                             
                             
                             
    - Draconic Bloodline Abilities:
       - Dragon Ancestor: you choose one type of Dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each Dragon is used by features you gain later. You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a
                          Charisma check when interacting with Dragons, your Proficiency Bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

                    is also a Blood spell and does not require a spell slot if it would normally expend a spell slot of a spell level equal to or less than the number of hit dice you expended on this feature this turn. You 
                    cannot use this feature to cast a spell at a level higher than you have spell slots for (expended or otherwise) You also gain the ability to expend your life force more directly in the pursuit of powerful

                     attack, spell, or other effect, and you retain your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You otherwise use the possessed target's statistics, but don't gain access to the target's knowledge, class 
                     features, or proficiencies. At the start of each of your turns, if the possessed creature has been damaged at least once since the end of your last turn it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a
