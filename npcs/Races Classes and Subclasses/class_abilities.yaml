    - title: Pact Boon
    - content: Pact of the Blade - You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. 
                                   This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 
                                   minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by 
                                   performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it 
                                   into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact 
                                   weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the 
                                   extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
               Pact of the Chain - You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for 
                                   your familiar or one of the following special forms - imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
                                   Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack with its reaction.
               Pact of the Tome - Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book
                                  is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock 
                                  spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it 
                                  destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
               Pact of the Talisman - Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the 
                                      roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest. If you lose the talisman, you
                                      can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns 
                                      to ash when you die.
               Pact of the Star Chain - Prerequisite - Seeker Patron
                                        The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While the chain is on your person, you know the Augury spell and can cast it as a 
                                        ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker’s power to gain advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item.
                                        Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from the
                                        Seeker. The ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous chain. The chain disappears in a flash of light when you die. The exact form of this item 
                                        might be different depending on your patron. The Star Chain is inspired by the Greyhawk deity Celestian.

               all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
    - title: Eldritch Master
    - content: You can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from 
               your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

    - content: You can see and speak with spirits. You can see up to 60 ft into the Ethereal Plane while in the Material Plane, and vice versa. You can also gain some benefits after communing with nature for 1 minute.
               When you forage alone, you find twice as much as you normally would.
               You can move stealthily at a normal pace.
               You are aware of recent events in the region, like storms, landslides, etc.
    - title: Spiritual Animal
    - content: You can cast the "Find Familiar" spell as a ritual. Your familiar is always an undead. Your familiar is a spirit, which means it can see 60 ft into the Ethereal Plane while in the Material Plane and 
               vice versa, it can pass through other creatures and objects (it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn on an occupied space), it doesn't have a walking speed, instead, it has a flight speed of 40ft 
               and it can hover (familiars that already have flight speeds keep their value, but lose their walking speed like the others) and it can become invisible with an action.
    - title: Spiritual Possession
    - content: You can use your action to enter a trance and allow a beastly spirit to possess your body, giving you the abilities of the spirit. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you 
               finish a short or long rest. (Optional Rule - the Shaman must have collected the spirit of the animal you wish to channel. to collect you must be aware of the spirit of a creature that meets the 
               requirements and succeed on an animal handling check. When using this rule some monstrosities such as winter wolf may be allowed). Your shaman level determines the spirit that can possess you. 
               You can be possessed by the spirit of a beast with a CR of no more than half your shaman level (rounded down). When you channel you do not gain lair actions or legendary resistances. You can maintain 
               the possession by a number of hours equal to half your shaman level (rounded down). You then end the possession unless you expend another use of this feature.. You can also end the possession with a 
               bonus action in your turn. You automatically end the possession if you fall to 0 hit points, or die. While you are possessed, the following rules apply 
               1. Some of your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast whose spirit is possessing you. Those being, its Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores, its attacks, its senses and 
                  any other personal features. You don't gain its hit points, AC, or any special types of movement (like flight). Changes in Dex or Con do not effect your AC or HP and only apply for the sake of 
                  checks, saves, and attacks.
               2. When you use your action to make an attack from your possessing spirit it appears as a spectral apparition of the attack, and while you deal the damage type and dice of the attack, you still use 
                  your weapon on the attack, so, if you use a ranged weapon, like a bow, you can still make any attack from your spirit, like a bite attack. Also, any extra damage, or bonus to attack rolls you gain 
                  from magical weapons still affect your spirit attacks.
               3. Your spirit's senses overlap yours, so you lose any senses you possess that your spirit doesn't posses with exception to your ethereal sight.
               4. At level 7 your spirit's attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity against nonmagical damage and attacks. When you reach 11th level, you gain temporary 
                  hit points equal to your shaman level when you become possessed. These hit points last until the end of the possession.

               You cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. As long as you have a familiar you gain access to spells regardless of the familiar's distance or occupied plane of existence.
    - title: Binding Rites
    - content: You can bind spirits to your service, taking 10 minutes of uninterrupted activity. During this time, the witch enacts the rite of binding depending on which philosophy the witch belongs to. A blood witch 
               might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit’s service. When you choose a spirit to bind from the list 
               at the end of this class description, you fill one of your available spell slots with the spirit. The spell slot used is no longer available for casting spells, and it remains unavailable for as long as 
               the spirit filling it remains bound to you. The spirit is said to be of a level equal to the spell slot filled to bind it. Thus, a Spirit of Passion occupying a 6th level spell slot is a level 6 spirit. 
               You cannot have more than one spirit with the same name bound at one time. You can have a number of spirits bound equal to the number in the class table. Depending on the type of spirit, you gain certain 
               benefits while the spirit remains bound and an additional effect when you release the spirit, as detailed in the Binding Rites section. Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow 
               release as a reaction. Once a spirit has been released, it no longer provides its passive effect and the spell slot it occupied is considered expended. A witch may exchange any spirit they have bound by 
               performing the ritual as described above.
               Binding Rites - 
               Agony - In the presence of a spirit of Agony, foes’ wounds continue to bleed and fires continue to burn. While Agony is bound, when you roll damage for an attack or spell you cast, for each 1 on a damage 
                       die, you can add the level of the spirit to the damage total. Release. You can release Agony as a reaction when you roll the highest possible number on a damage die. Roll a number of d6s equal to 
                       the spirit's level and add the total to the triggering damage as psychic damage.
               Desire - Spirits of Desire impress your will onto others and enhance existing desires. Friendly and charmed creatures within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your spells. 
                        Once a creature succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against one of your spells, that creature is immune to this spirit’s passive effect for 24 hours. Release. When you release this spirit as a bonus
                        action, you attempt to charm a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until it
                        takes damage. The spirit's level determines what kind of creature can be charmed. At 3rd level and below, only humanoids and beasts are affected. At 4th level and above, all creatures can be 
                        affected.
               Empathy - Spirits of Empathy force your enemies to share your pain. While Empathy is bound, whenever a creature deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to retaliate. The creature takes psychic 
                         damage equal to the spirit's level. Release. You can release Empathy as a reaction whenever a creature deals damage to you or an ally within 30 feet of you. The creature takes psychic damage 
                         equal to the triggering damage + the spirit’s level.
               Envy - Spirits of Envy take from others what they covet for themselves – life. Once on each of your turns, when you damage a creature with an attack or spell while Envy is bound, you regain a number of hit
                      points equal to the level of the spirit. Release. When you deal damage to a creature with an attack or spell you can release Envy as a reaction. When you do so, you gain a number of temporary hit 
                      points equal to the triggering damage.
               Fear - Spirits of Fear bring nightmares to life. While Fear is bound, you can add your proficiency bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) checks, or double it if you already do. Additionally, creatures provoke 
                      opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach. Release. When Fear is released from its bonds as a bonus action, a number of creatures equal to the
                      spirit's level within 30 feet of you must succeed on Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end 
                      of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
               Generosity - Spirits of Generosity are always willing to make sacrifices for those who bind them with good intentions. Your spells that restore hit points restore additional hit points equal to the 
                            spirit's level. Release. You can release Generosity as a bonus action and gift the spirit to an ally within 30 feet of you. The spirit protects the ally, granting them a number of temporary 
                            hit points equal to 5 times the spirit's level. These temporary hit points last 10 minutes.
               Guilt - Spirits of Guilt cause your enemies hesitation in acts that would wrong you. While Guilt is bound, when you are attacked you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to AC against that attack equal to
                       the level of the spirit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the spirit's level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Release. When you release Guilt from your 
                       power as a bonus action, one creature you can see within 60 feet has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turn the target can make a Wisdom saving throw 
                       against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.
               Hate - Spirits of Hate inspire a ferocity in you. When you are damaged by a creature, you can choose to channel Hate and gain advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next 
                      turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the spirit's level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Release. When you damage a creature with a spell or attack you
                      can release Hate as a reaction. Roll a number of d6s equal to the spirit's level and add the total to the triggering damage as necrotic damage.
               Humility - When you make an ability check with which you are not proficient at disadvantage, the result can not be lower than 8 + the level of this spirit.Release. As a reaction when a creature you can see
                          makes a saving throw or ability check, you can release Humility from your power to bestow it upon the creature. Add the spirit’s level to the roll. You can do so after the roll, but must decide 
                          before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
               Hunger - Spirits of Hunger sustain their binder and deprive their enemies of energy. While Hunger is bound you require no food or water. Release. You can release Hunger as a bonus action to exhaust a 
                        number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to the spirit’s level. A target gains one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A of the Player's Handbook), and cannot be affected by a 
                        Spirit of Hunger for 24 hours.
               Passion - Spirits of Passion give those who bind them the power to push themselves and others to greater heights of success. While this spirit is bound you can channel Passion when you make an attack roll,
                         ability check or saving throw, or when an ally within 30 feet of you does, you roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the spirit's 
                         level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. You lose all remaining dice when you release Passion. Release. You can release Passion as a reaction when you make an attack roll,
                         ability check, or saving throw. You gain advantage on the roll. Additionally, you and each friendly creature within 30 feet of you gain a d6 that lasts until the end of your next turn. A creature
                         can expend and roll the d6 when they make an attack roll or ability check, adding it to the total.
               Pride - Creatures in your presence are more easily filled with a dangerous sense of pride, oversight, and overconfidence. When you make an ability check that is contested by a creature you can see, you 
                       gain a bonus to the ability check equal to the spirit's level. Release. When a creature you can see succeeds on an attack roll or ability check, you can release Pride as a reaction to curse that 
                       creature to a disgraceful fall. The next time the target makes an attack roll or ability check, it does so with disadvantage, and subtracts the spirit’s level from the total.
               Serenity - Spirits of Serenity bring peace and clarity of thought to those who bind them. You don't need to sleep. Instead, you can meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After 
                          resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Additionally, if you or any friendly creatures who can see you regain hit points at the end of a short 
                          rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains a number of additional hit points equal to the level of the spirit. Release. When you release Serenity from your power at 
                          the start of your turn (no action required), you are no longer blinded, deafened, frightened, paralysed, poisoned, or stunned.
               Sloth - Spirits of Sloth inspire sluggishness and laziness of thought and action around you. While Sloth is bound, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies. Release. When you 
                       release Sloth as a bonus action, you can slow a number of creatures up to the spirit's level that you can see. A target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save 
                       a target is slowed until the end of their next turn, and can take either an action or bonus action on their turn, not both.
               Sorrow - The failures of your enemies continue to haunt them in the presence of a spirit of Sorrow. While Sorrow is bound to you, when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells of 1st 
                        level or higher, it takes psychic damage equal to the spirit's level. Release. When Sorrow is released as a bonus action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target has 
                        disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn. If it misses that attack roll or fails the ability check, roll a number of d6s equal to the spirit's
                        level. The target takes psychic damage equal to the total.
               Trust - While emboldened by a spirit of trust, you can help your allies through cooperative spellcasting. While Trust is bound, when you finish a long rest you can choose a number of spells from the witch 
                       spell list equal to the spirit's level. You and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you of know these spells, and always have them prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells an 
                       affected creature can know or prepare. Release. You can release Trust when you take the Help action, as part of that action. When the target makes the attack roll or ability check that you aided, 
                       it can reroll one of the dice once.
               Valor - Spirits of Valor give those who bind them the power to pull through with confidence against poor odds. While Valor is bound, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saves
                       against being frightened. Release. When you release this spirit as a bonus action, you and a number of creatures equal to the spirit's level that you can see within 30 feet of you are no longer 
                       frightened.
               Wonder - You radiate an aura of awe when a spirit of Wonder is bound to you. While Wonder is bound, creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to 
                        perceive any creature other than you. Release. You can release Wonder from your power as an action to inspire awe in a number of creatures equal to the spirit's level that you can see within 30 
                        feet of you. A target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be incapacitated and have a speed of 0 until the end of your next turn.
    - title: Spirit Ward
    - content: You learn a rite that offers protection against spirits who wish you or your allies harm. As an action, you can create a spirit ward with a radius of 30 feet, centered on your location. The ward lasts 1 
               minute and is stationary for the duration. While inside the ward, friendly creatures (yourself included) cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by undead and have resistance to all damage from 
               incorporeal undead sources. Additionally, if a friendly creature is reduced to 0 hit points within the ward but is not killed outright, the creature becomes stable. You can use this feature 3 times. You 
               regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 9th level, you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

               If the familiar dies, the spirit you initially chose produces its release effect if you can see any valid targets within range of the familiar when it dies.
    - title: Ghostly Step
    - content: You gain the ability to enter the spirit realm as a bonus action by projecting part of yourself beyond the material plane. You and your belongings become invisible and incorporeal for up to 1 minute. You 
               gain resistance to all damage from non-magical sources, and are immune to being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained. During this time, you may move your normal speed and may pass through 
               solid objects. If you end your turn in an object, you are dealt 1d10 force damage. You may rematerialize in your present location as a bonus action. If you choose to maintain this form until the duration 
               expires and you are in a location occupied by a creature or solid object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved as a result. 
               Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
