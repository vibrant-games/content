  - title: Lurker in the Deep Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Grasp of the Deep
    - content: You gain the ability to magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle
               lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle. When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the
               target takes 1d8 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage) and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the
               damage dealt by the tentacle increases to 2d8. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack. You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to
               your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    - title: Scion of the Deep
    - content: Your patron accepts you into its inner court of servitors. You can telepathically communicate with any aberration, beast, elemental, or monstrosity that has an innate swimming speed, while it is 
               within 120 feet of you. The creature can understand you and can respond telepathically.
    - title: Fathomless Soul
    - content: Your patron grants you greater abilities. You gain the following benefits; 
               You can breathe both air and water.
               You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
               You gain resistance to cold damage.
    - title: Guardian Grasp
    - content: The tentacle you create with Grasp of the Deep can defend you and others. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of 
               those creatures and reduce the damage to the chosen creature by half. After doing so, the tentacle vanishes.
    - title: Devouring Maw
    - content: You can magically draw forth a manifestation of your patron’s insatiable hunger. As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. For 1 minute, a translucent maw manifests in a 10-foot 
               radius centered on that point. Each creature in that area when the maw appears must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained. Any creature that starts its turn in the
               maw’s area takes 3d6 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage). As an action, a restrained creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the restraint on a success. At the start of 
               your turn, if there is a creature in the maw’s area, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
    - title: Unleash the Depths
    - content: You gain the ability to call upon your patron for aid. As an action, you choose a point within 30 feet of you where your patron tears through reality, manifesting a measure of its thalassic grandeur.
               Choose one of the following effects to issue from this manifestation point. Once you use either effect, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
               Transport - You and up to five willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point are grasped by spectral tentacles and yanked through your patron’s realm. 
                           The tentacles teleport you and the chosen creatures to a point of your choice within 100 miles that you have visited within the past 24 hours. The tentacles then vanish.
               Fury - You can direct a barrage of spectral tentacles to issue forth and strike up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point. Each target must make a Dexterity saving 
                      throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 cold or lightning damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and
                      is not knocked prone. The tentacles then vanish
   
   
                                     
  - title: Noble Genie Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Collectors Vessel
    - content: Your patron gives you a magical vessel with which you can bind a creature to you and to your patron’s menagerie. The vessel is a Tiny object, and it is a spellcasting focus for you. You decide what 
               the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Collector’s Vessel table.
               Collector’s Vessel Table
               d6   Vessel
                1   Oil lamp
                2   Urn
                3   Ring with a compartment
                4   Stoppered bottle
                5   Hollow statuette
                6   Ornate lantern
               If you lose your vessel, you can perform a 1- hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous vessel. 
               The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die. As an action while you are holding the vessel, you target a willing creature you can see within 100 feet of you and create a tether of 
               wispy elemental material that links the target to you. The tether lasts for 1 hour, until you use this feature to create another tether, until the bound target is reduced to 0 hit points, or until 
               the target ends its turn more than 100 feet from you. While you are tethered to a creature, you gain the following benefits;
               You gain a bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).
               When you can cast a spell, you can deliver the spell from your space or the bound creature’s space.
               You can create the tether a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    - title: Protective Wish
    - content: You’re now able to use your Collector’s Vessel to wish for protection for yourself or your tethered creature. If you or the tethered creature is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to teleport, 
               swapping places with the creature and switching which one of you is hit by the attack
    - title: Genies Entertainment
    - content: As an action, you can attempt to send a creature you can see within 90 feet to your patron’s court. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be 
               magically drawn into your vessel and teleported to your patron’s court in the Elemental Planes. While there, the target is stunned and your patron marvels at the target with amusement but brings 
               no harm to it. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, reappearing in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied on a success.
               Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. If the target remains in your patron’s court for 1 minute, the genie sends the target back at the end of its turn as 
               if it successfully saved, and you regain the use of this feature.
    - title: Collectors Call
    - content: In exchange for extending your patron’s influence over the multiverse, you can call on more of their power. As an action, you can implore your patron for aid by making a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
               against your warlock spell save DC. If the check succeeds, you can choose one of the following effects;
               A creature you can see within 60 feet of you regains 8d6 hit points and ends one disease or condition afflicting it; blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
               A creature you can see within 60 feet of you has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
               You cast the Legend Lore spell without material components.
               Whether the check succeeds or fails, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. Alternatively, you can regain the use of this feature by sacrificing nonmagical treasure worth at 
               least 500 gp to your patron. This sacrifice requires the treasure to be within 10 feet of you for at least 1 minute, at the end of which you use an action to teleport the treasure to your patron’s realm,
               provided you have the vessel of your Collector’s Vessel in hand.

    - title: Hexblades Curse
    - content: You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target
               dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits - 
               You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
               Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
               If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier
    - title: Hex Warriors
    - content: You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long 
               rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity,
               for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature,
               no matter the weapon's type.
    - title: Accursed Specter
    - content: You can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears,
               it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack 
               rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife
    - title: Armor of Hexes
    - content: Your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, 
               regardless of its roll
    - title: Master of Hexes
    - content: You can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see 
               within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature

    - title: Sentinel Raven
    - content: You gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give 
               telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to 
               Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can’t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it 
               can’t take damage; and it is incapacitated. You can see through the raven’s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it
               acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours. The raven doesn’t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you
               from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you,
               no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.
    - title: Soul of the Raven
    - content: You gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven’s form. While merged, you become Tiny, you replace
               your speed with the raven’s, and you can use your action only to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, or Search. During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. As
               an action, you and the raven return to normal.
    - title: Ravens Shield
    - content: The Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing. You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the frightened condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.
    - title: Queens Right Hand
    - content: You can channel the Raven Queen’s power to slay a creature. You can cast Finger of Death. After you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

    - title: Entropis Ward
    - content: You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
               impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't
               use it again until you finish a short or long rest 
    - title: Thought Shield
    - content: Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the 
               same amount of damage that you do.
    - title: Create Thrall
    - content: You gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a Remove 
               Curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the 
               same plane of existence.

    - title: Among the Dead
    - content: You learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease. Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an 
               undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area 
               effect, such as the explosion of Fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful
               save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.
    - title: Defy Death
    - content: You can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on 
               a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
    - title: Undying Nature
    - content: You can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. In 
               addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.
    - title: Indestructible Life
    - content: You partake of some of the true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your warlock level. Additionally, if you put a severed body 
               part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

    - title: Form of Dread
    - content: As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed;
               You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.
               Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of 
               your next turn.
               You are immune to the frightened condition.
               You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your 
               patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your face might transform into bat-like features due to your vampire patron.
    - title: Grave Touched
    - content: Your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe. In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, 
               you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.
    - title: Mortal Husk
    - content: Your connection to undeath and necrotic energy now saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread, you instead become immune to necrotic 
               damage. In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can cause your body to explode. Each creature within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level. You then revive
               with 1 hit point in your previous space, along with your gear, and you gain 1 level of exhaustion. Once you revive this way, you can’t do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.
    - title: Spirit Projection
    - content: Your body is now simply a vessel for your spirit. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation. Your 
               spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body 
               magically teleports to your spirit’s space (your choice). While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits;
               Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
               When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.
               You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
               While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
               Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

                                 let bonded creatures know they are ok. (example; a wounded barbarian has a bleeding gash in his leg that leaves him at 2 HP, the connected witch feels the same pain as if she had a great
                                 gash in her leg she knows he needs help, but is not harmed herself).

                                      save. You do not need materials for this hex. A creature with C/R equal to or greater than 1/4th your witch level has advantage on its constitution save. At 18th level you can choose

                          the eye as if it where their own (you maintain the ability to recieve visual information from the eye if you so choose). At 18th level the eye gains darkvision to 60 feet and can percieve 
                          invisible creatures up to 30 feet. If the eye is within a creature it makes seperate perception checks, and can replace a perception roll of the creature with its own if the check relies on

                          aged 2x quicker, essentially doubling its current age. The creature gains any defining features of an aged member of its race, and it suffers disadvantage on all charisma checks until a remove 
                          curse spell is used on it or the witch ends the hex. At 18th level the aging is no longer in appearence only. A creature that has failed its save has its age doubled and it suffers any penalties
                          and gains any benefits from its older age, and if the creature would surpass the maximum age normal for its race it dies of old age.

                              beginning of each of its turn as long as it remains in an area with vegitation or in direct sunlight. Leaving such an area ends this healing. At 18th level the healing from this hex increases
                              to 2d4 + your spellcasting modifier. In addition, his hex no longer requires the target to be standing in vegetation or sunlight, but if they do the healing increases to 4d4.

                           already in a creature’s hands, but does prevent an archer from drawing arrows. A wisdom save negates this effect against the warlock's spell save, and whether or not the save is successful, a 
                           creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1-hour. Attacking a creature under this effect immediatley ends this hex. At 18th level this hex effects natural weapons, and a creature with 
                           a weapon in their hand drops the weapon if they fail their saving throw. In addition, a creature that takes any hostile actions while under the effect of this hex (threats, intimidation, or the 
                           casting of a damaging spell) takes 1d10 radiant damage. While in combat this damage can only occur once per turn.
               Gheist Ward - You create a spiritual barrier to ward off spirits. This ward covers a 30ft radius centered on you and remains stationary for the duration of this hex. This barrier lasts for a number of

                             outright, become stable. At 18th level spells cast by undead and incorporeal creatures cannot target or effect creatures within the barrier. Additionally, creatures within have advantage on 
                             saving throws to resist or stop any ongoing effect placed on them by an undead or incorporeal creature.
               Potion Steep - You spend 1-minute steeping a fruit in one potion or poison of your choice within a cauldron. Doing so consumes the potion or poison. The fruit is imbued with the effect of the potion, any 
                              creature that consumes the fruit is affected as if it consumed the potion. In order to detect the potion/poison imbued in the fruit a creature must make a DC 20 investigation check, otherwise
                              it appears mundane. The duration of any potion/poison with a duration of 1minute or more is doubled, up to a maximum of 24 hours. At 18th level you can choose to steep a hero's feast (Feeds 
                              roughly 13 creatures, refer to the spell of the same name) worth of food, spending 1 hour to do so. In addition, the DC of the food's saving throws are increased by +2.
               Shadow Servant - Prerequisites - 3rd level - You animate your shadow to act independently of you. Your shadow springs to life as if you had cast the spell Unseen Servant. However, it can be seen (as your

                                take the attack action. If it drops to 0 hit points, your shadow reverts to its normal form. If you choose the attack action the shadow makes a melee attack against the target. This attack 
                                deals 2d6 necrotic damage and has an attack bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier. Your shadow remains animated for 1 hour, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. At 18th level your
                                shadow has an AC of 15, hit points equal to 10 + half your warlock level (rounded down, minimum 1), and a Strength of 15 + your charisma modifier. Its attack damage also increases to 4d6 
                                necrotic damage.
               Soothsayer - Prerequisites - 6th level - You touch a creature and gain a glimpse of their near future. You gain a vague idea of one event in the creature's future in the form of a misty set of images and 
                            hushed whispers (information given at your DM's discretion). You can share this information with the target in the form of a vague fortune. If the creature's near future contains a great 
                            tragedy you can turn the vision back on the creature, dealing 6d6 psychic damage if they fail a wisdom saving throw. If the vision contains a good event you can instill the target with great 
                            confidence in their future, it gains advantage on all charisma checks for the next hour (this ignores the ability check reduction of the first level of exhaustion). Regardless of the result of 
                            the vision, the target suffers one level of exhaustion. At 18th level your visions are clearer and you can see farther into the future. In addition, you can choose to have the target no longer 
                            suffer from exhaustion.

                              within 30ft. as part of this hex. If you succeed the target becomes charmed by you for a number of minutes equal to your charisma modifier. In addition, a creature affected by this feature 
                              does not know it was charmed once it wears off. At 18th level you can target an additional number of creatures equal to your charisma modifier.
               Magic Door - Prerequisites - 10th level - You must touch a door, or door-like opening large enough for a medium creature to enter (but no larger), as part of this hex and speak a command word of your 
                            choice. You link all doors or openings affected by this hex together with magic. The first door affected by this hex is known as the master door. Whenever near the master door you can use your 
                            action to speak the command word of any other connected door, doing so opens a magic portal between the two doors. When you open the master door after doing so it no longer opens to its normal
                            location, but the location on the other side of the linked door or opening. Stepping through the door teleports you to the other side of the linked door. You can speak the command word again to
                            close the magic link, allowing the doors to function as normal. When near a linked door that is not the master door you may only use the command word to open a portal back to the master door. 
                            You can have a number of linked doors equal to your charisma modifier (minimum 1, not counting the master door). If you use this hex while you have the maximum number of linked doors you must 
                            chose a door that is not the master door to unlink before linking the new door. You can also cast this hex to designate a new door as the master door. At 18th level you may now target any 
                            opening large enough for a creature of large or smaller to fit through. You can also now link a number of doors equal to 5 + your charisma modifier.
               Wiccan Grotto - You spend 1 hour in a special ritual, when the ritual is complete you transform a 30ft cube area of vegitation at a target location within 30ft. The grotto flurishes, and any withered or 
                               dead vegitation in the area regrows rapidly. This hex removes any curses or hexes placed on the area by any creature or caster that has a CR lower than 1/2 your witch level. In addition, the
                               grotto contains enough fruits and edible plants to sustain up to five creatures for a day. If you cast this spell in an area with at least one adult tree you can designate it to become a 
                               wiccan tree. While you are within 30ft of a wiccan tree you can commune telepathically with any witch that is within your coven that is also near a wiccan tree, so long as you are both on 
                               the same plane. The grotto lasts for 24 hours before returning to its original state. If you cast this hex in the same spot every day for one month the grotto becomes permanent. At 18th 
                               level if you are casting a spell or ritual with a casting time of one minute or more within 30 ft of the wiccan tree any number of witches from your coven who are also within 30ft of the 
                               wiccan tree can assist in the spellcasting to reduce the time by an appropriate amount (to a minimum if 1 action), so long as you are all on the same plane. (Example; Two witches cast a 
                               spell with a casting time of one hour two times as fast, reducing the casting time to thirty minutes. Likewise, a coven of ten witches could cast a spell with a casting time of one hour in 
                               six minutes.)
               Witchs Brew - Prerequisites - 3rd level - Over the course of 10 minutes, you create a special potion. To use this invocation, you must have alchemist’s supplies or a cauldron with you. While brewing this 
                             potion you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to create a Witch's Brew. When you expend this spell slot, choose a spell that could be cast with that slot and has a casting time of one 
                             action or less, your brew becomes charged with that spell. Any creature that drinks this potion is affected by the spell as if it was cast on it, making any saving throws as appropriate. You 
                             can have only one witch brew at a time. If you create another witch's brew your previous brew loses its magic. The brew retains its magic for 24 hours before becomimg inert. In addition, once 
                             a day you can choose to create a potion imbued with the power of one of your hexes. Any creature that consumes this potion is affected by the hex as if cast by its creator. The witch can’t use
                             that hex until the potion is consumed or rendered inert. Only hexes that can target a creature other than the witch can be distilled in this way. The potion remains potent until consumed or 
                             rendered inert by the witch as a bonus action. The DC of any hex is increased by 2 when it is instilled in a potion form. These potions do not count against the total number of witch brews you
                             can have. At 18th level you can have a number of witch's brews equal to your charisma modifier.
               Witch's Curse - Prerequisites - 10th level - You curse a creature with an aweful malady. Choose one of the following effects
                               The target becomes sterile, or unable to concieve a particular gender of child (your choice).
                               The target is doomed to a failed love life.
                               The target becomes terribly disfigured in a way you choose.
                               The target becomes addicted to something.
                               The target is doomed to poverty.
                               The target doubles the amount of negative character traits it gains over its lifetime.
                               The target becomes afraid of one thing of your choice.
                               You curse the target with a custom malady that is not any more powerful than the others on this list. This custom curse must be approved by your DM.
                               At 18th level you can have this curse pass down to the target's children, affecting a number of generations up to your charisma modifier. You can also set restrictions upon the curse (such as
                               only the males of the cursed individual inherits the curse, or so on).
               Witchfire - Prerequisites - 3rd level - You create a 15ft cone of green-black flame that gives off no light, each creature in the area of the cone must make a dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 
                           fire damage and 1d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The flame is particularly "sticky" and clings to surfaces and burns any unattended object 
                           within the cone for maximum damage, in addition the flame sticks on surfaces (including water), lingering for a number of rounds equal to your charisma modifier. A creature that fails its saving
                           throw by 5 or more takes an additional 1d6 fire and 1d6 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns as the flame sticks to them. A creature can use its action to make a new a dexterity
                           saving throw to scrape off the sticky substance, ending the flames torment, but not dowsing it. In addition, a creature that starts or ends its turn in the area of the cursed flame must make a 
                           new dexterity saving throw or be burned by the flame. The flame cannot be put out by non-magical means and can exist in oxygen deprived areas, even underwater. The damage of each type increases 
                           to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 16th level. At 18th level the cone increases to 30ft, or you can change it to a 5x60 line. In addition, all creatures effected by witchfire 
                           have disadvantage on any saving throws against your hexes or spells classified as curses.
               Witch's Hut - Prerequisites - 10th level - You touch a hut or other abode that can fit within a 30x30x30ft cube. The hut becomes sentient, as if affected by the spell Awaken. The hut sprounts legs or other 
                            appropriate limbs and other senses as per the spell and obeys your commands. Your DM chooses a stat block appropriate for the newly awakened creature. You can only have one such sentient hut at
                            a time, using this hex on another abode renders the previous abode inert. In addition you can telepathically communicate with the hut so long as it remains on the same plane of existance. At 
                            18th level you can target a hut or abode that can fit within a 60x60x60 ft cube.
               Witch's Luck - Prerequisites - 6th level - You grant an individual abounding luck or terrible misfortune. You grant a creature within 30ft an inspiration die that must be used within the next 1 minute. Or 
                             you can choose to impose a misfortune upon a creature that fails its wisdom saving throw, allowing you to subtract 1d6 from one of the creature's rolls within the next minute before the 
                             results of the roll are resolved. At 18th level the duration of this hex increases to 1-hour and you can grant a friendly creature 1 reroll of a failed roll instead of the inspiration die, or 
                             you can cause a creature to immediately fail its next throw if it failed to resist this hex.
               Witching Ward - You create a magical barrier around a target, shielding them from misfortune. The warded creature receives a +2 bonus to AC and has advantage on saving throws against witch hexes and curses.
                               This ward lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A witch can have only one ward active at a time. If the
                               witch uses this ability again, the previous ward immediately ends. You can cast this hex as a reaction when you or a target within 60 ft of you is the target of a hex or a curse that you 
                               have successfully identified. At 18th level the AC provided by this ward increase to +4 and the target is immune to hexes and curses cast by creatures with CR lower than 1/4 of your level in
                               this class.

    - title: Accursed Retainers
    - content: The dead serve your will, and the will of your dread patron through you. Your patron instills in you the power to call the dead to bended knee, and the keen senses to detect where the dead lie 
               buried. As an action you may raise a skeletal retainer from an available corpse or bone pile. Thise retainers have AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 8, and cannot attack or speak. You may only 
               have one skeletal retainer raised and accompanying you at any time. Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the retainer to move up to 15 feet and interact with an 
               object. The retainer can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you 
               give the command, the retainer performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. If you command the retainer to perform a task that would 
               move it more than 60 feet away from you, it will wait at the edge of the 60-foot radius for further commands. At 5th level, your retainer gains a Charisma score of 6 and can speak simple words and 
               phrases. At 9th level, the retainer has the ability to detect all undead or intact corpses dead for more than a day within 60 feet of it and not behind total cover, but will not necessarily have 
               the initiative to inform you of a presence unless you ask it directly. Starting at 13th level, your retainer gains an Intelligence score of 10, training in Arcana, History, or Religion (you choice,
               when you raise the retainer) which uses your proficiency bonus, and it gains the ability to speak fluently in full sentences. At 17th level, you may raise up to two retainers, and may have a 
               maximum of two retainers accompanying you at any time.
    - title: Master of Death
    - content: The will of your patron flows through you, and you have become versed in channeling it into the bones of the dead to raise powerful, combat-ready servants. Once you reach 6th level, you may, as an 
               action use a warlock spell slot to raise one undead minion, either a skeleton elite, flame skeleton, or warhorse skeleton, from a corresponding pile of bones or corpse (from a horse for the warhorse, 
               from a Small or Medium humanoid for the others) within 10 feet. The statistics for the skeleton elite and flame skeleton are available at the end of this document, and the statistics for the warhorse 
               skeleton may be found on page 273 of the Monster Manual, with the exception that the warhorse you raise may not attack. Undead creatures raised by this feature gain the following benefits
               The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your warlock level.
               The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls from attacks.
               You may raise up to two of the creatures from this list instead of one at 7th level, and up to three of the creatures here at 9th level. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally 
               command any creature you made with this ability if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same 
               command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. 
               If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. These creatures last until 
               they are killed or until the end of the next short or long rest, upon which they crumble into dust. If these creatures would expire due to a rest, you can instead gain one less warlock spell slot from
               the rest per each spell slot spent on this feature to keep them active.

               within five feet of you, you may use your reaction to take half the triggering damage and have the undead creature you control take the same amount of damage, of the same type and from the same source.
