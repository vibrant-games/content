    - title: Emboldening Bond
    - content: You can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) and create a magical bond between them.
               While either bonded creature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add 
               the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again. You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can
               also expend a spell slot to use the feature again.
    - title: Channel Divinity - Shared Burden
    - content: You can use your Channel Divinity to protect your allies through the strength of your shared bonds. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your 
               reaction to choose a number of other willing creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). Distribute the damage taken 
               between the original target and the chosen creatures. Each creature must take at least 1 damage. Apply any damage resistance or vulnerability of the creatures involved after you 
               distribute the damage.
    - title: Protective Bond
    - content: The bond you forge between people shields them from harm. While either creature chosen for your Emboldening Bond feature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can use its reaction to grant 
               resistance to all damage to the other creature when that other creature takes damage. This resistance lasts until the end of the current turn.
    - title: Potent Spellcasting
    - content: You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 
    - title: Enduring Unity
    - content: The bonds you create endure across vast distances. Creatures affected by your Emboldening Bond feature gain its benefits, as well as those of your Protective Bond feature, while they are on the same 
               plane of existence as each other. Additionally, when a creature chosen for your Emboldening Bond is reduced to 0 hit points, their bonded partner gains the following benefits for 1 minute, or until the 
               creature regains at least 1 hit point;
               The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws
               The creature gains resistance to all damage
               As an action, the creature can touch their bonded partner to expend and roll any number of Hit Dice. Their bonded partner regains a number of hit points equal to the total rolled.

               to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally,

               that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns 
               trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only 
               use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. After you reach 5th level, 
               when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the Banishment spell, no concentration required) if 
               it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.

               suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice 
               on a surface within 5 feet of you. The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, 
               with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

               prophetic. The DM rolls a d6 in secret. On a roll of a 5 or 6, the DM shows you a likely future involving a real threat you're likely to face soon. On any other roll the DM shows you a paranoid 
               vision of an unlikely future involving threats that are not real or that you're unlikely to face, such as a betrayal from allies that are actually trustworthy, or an attack from monsters that 
               aren't actually present in the immediate area. You can enter this trance a number of times equal to your cleric level divided by 4 (a minimum of once).

               half your cleric level and it becomes  addled with dread for 1 minute. A creature addled with this dread treats all other creatures as enemies for the purpose of disadvantage for
