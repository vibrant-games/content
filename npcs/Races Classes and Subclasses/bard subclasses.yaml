    - title: Note of Potential
    - content: When you join the College of Creation at 3rd level, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which 
               orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another 
               symbol of art or life that you choose. When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack roll, or 
               a saving throw, as detailed below;
    - content: Ability Check - When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops
                               and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.
    - content: Attack Roll - Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice
                             that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration 
                             die.
    - content: Saving Throw - Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary 
                              hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
    - title: Performance of Creation
    - content: As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in
               a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly 
               hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can create, see the equipment chapter of the Player's 
               Handbook. Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use this feature again. You can 
               have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes. The size of the item you can create 
               with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).
    - title: Animating Performance
    - content: As an action, you can target a Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency 
               bonus (PB), The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die. In combat, the item shares your 
               initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus 
               action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not 
               just Dodge. When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration. Once you animate an item with this feature, you 
               can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if 
               you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

    - title: Universal Speech

               check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can use your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a 
               Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all 
               expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    - title: Bonus Proficiencies

    - title: Connoisseur of Symbols
    - content: You have advantage on any ability check that you make using Arcana, History, Nature, Religion or your Tattooist’s Supplies or Calligrapher’s Supplies proficiencies to determine the nature of a
               tattoo, sigil, or symbol. This includes symbols using a language you do not understand, so long as the symbol is mostly comprised of other shapes and images. This allows you to identify magic
               tattoos with a successful check as well as understand basic warnings and information communicated through markings
    - title: Lasting Inspiration
    - content: You can imbue your Bardic Inspiration into a tattoo. When you are tattooing someone, you may expend all remaining uses of your Bardic Inspiration to imbue one Bardic Inspiration die into the tattoo.
               The tattoo receives your current Bardic Inspiration die and does not increase when you increase in level. Once the tattoo is complete, the bearer may use a bonus action to activate the tattoo, adding
               your Bardic Inspiration die to their next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Once the recipient has used the tattoo in this fashion, it cannot be used again until they complete a long rest.
               You may add Lasting Inspiration to any tattoo you craft, be it magical or not. Adding Lasting Inspiration to a magical tattoo does not impact or impede its other effects in any way. Once your Bardic
               Inspiration die has increased, you may spend one hour performing a touch up on a tattoo you have previously invested with Lasting Inspiration. At the end of the hour, you expend one use of your
               Bardic Inspiration. Once this is complete, the Lasting Inspiration die increases to your current Bardic Inspiration die. You cannot perform touch ups in this way on another artist’s tattoos. In
               addition, you are now considered to have achieved the necessary tattoo artist notoriety required to study under an established tattoo adept, even if you have never maintained a shop
    - title: Magical Tattoo Flash

               consumes one piece of paper or parchment. At the completion of the 10 minutes you spend a spell slot to cast any one bard spell you know into the flash art. The flash art then becomes a scroll, 
               which can be activated with a command word of your choosing. When creating magical tattoo flash, you must fulfill all components and costs of the spell normally. Anything consumed in the casting 
               of the spell is consumed. If you are interrupted for more than one round while creating magical tattoo flash, all time, materials and your expenditure of Bardic Inspiration are wasted. Finally, 
               anyone who is proficient with Tattooist’s Supplies who has access to a piece of your magical tattoo flash can use it to craft a magical tattoo granting the bearer the ability to cast the spell once
               per long rest. Using magical tattoo flash in this fashion consumes the flash, but also allows the magical tattoo flash to fulfill the place of the spellcaster in the requirements for creating 
               magical tattoos (see Scarred Lands Player’s Guide, Chapter Seven.)
               Magic Tattoos - Each body part can have only one magic tattoo. These rules assume a humanoid creature will have one head, one torso, two arms and two legs, for a maximum of five magic tattoos. 
                               Please note that a magic tattoo can be placed on any available body part unless the item description says otherwise. Tattoos carrying Bardic Inspiration through the Lasting 
                               Inspiration class feature do not count as magical for the purposes of determining whether a body part is used, unless those tattoos are also magical. Tattoos created through the 
                               Tattoo Adept’s Dancing Ink feature also do not count against this maximum.

  - abilities: 
    - title: Psychic Blades
    - content: You gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an 
               additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn. The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6
               at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.
    - title: Words of Terror
    - content: You learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its 
               mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in 
               this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to 
               frighten it. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.
    - title: Mantle of Whispers
    - content: You gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or 
               you finish a long rest. You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy 
               and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual 
               acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by 
               drawing on its memories. Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check. 
               Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.
    - title: Shadow Lore
    - content: You gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears. As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can
               hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your 
               whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. If the target fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. It interprets 
               the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. While you gain no knowledge of this secret, the target is convinced you know it. While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for 
               fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend. When the 
               effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

               whether it hits or misses.

    - title: In Virtute Spiritus
    - content: You become more talented at managing the soul energy derived from your deals, and can use it to gain a mote of arcane power. You can now hold a number of Soul dice equal to your Charisma modifier,
               and your Soul dice last until they' re depleted or you finish a long rest. In addition, when you finish a short rest, you can roll one of your Soul dice, choosing expended spell slots to recover. 
               The spell slots can have a combined level of half the number rolled (minimum of one) and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
               finish a long rest.
