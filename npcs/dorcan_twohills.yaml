# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

  specialties:
    skills:
   - - Firbolg Abilities:
       - Firbolg Magic: You can cast Detect Magic and Disguise Self with this trait, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it again with this trait until you finish a
                        short or long rest. When you use this version of disguise self, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you to more easily blend in with humans and elves.           
       - Hidden Step: As a bonus action, you can magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can't
                      use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
       - Powerful Build: You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift
       - Speech of Beast and Leaf: You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with beasts and plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return.
                                   You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them

   - - Cleric Abilities:
       - Spellcasting: DC 15
         Cantrips: Guidance, Sacred Flame, Thaumaturgy, Resistance
         1st Level: Bless, Sancturay, Purify Food and Water, Detect Poison and Disease
         2nd Level: Calm Emotions, Prayer of Healing, Lesser Restoration
         3rd Level: Create Food and Water, Remove Curse, Speak with Dead
         4th Level: Banishment, Divination 
       - Channel Divinity: Turn Undead, Destroy Undead 
       
   - - Grave Domain Abilities:
       - Circle of Mortality: you gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use
                              the highest number possible for each die. In addition, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet,
                              and you can cast it as a bonus action   
       - Eyes of the Grave: you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead.
                            Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you
                            anything about a creature's capabilities or identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier
       - Path to the Grave:  you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your
                             next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.
       - Sentinel at Deaths Door: you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit.
                                  Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier
       - Potent Spellcasting: you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip
       - Spellcasting: DC 15
         1st Level: Bane, False Life

    background-story: |
      The TwoHills clan has been the local Firbog tribe's caretakers of the dead for centuries and Dorcan is no different. He genuinely cares for the dead and their families. He loves the quiet and peacefulness of his inherited
      profession. He is a devout follower of the nature god Lallanis and draws his powers from her. His garden and chapel is lush and well kept, with all manner of flora and fungi. He is always welcoming, although he always
      keeps a close eye on non-Firbolgs when they're around. The garland of flowers that he wears around his neck at all times is the holy symbol that he uses as his spellcasting focus.
