    background-story: |
      The TwoHills clan has been the local Firbog tribe's caretakers of the dead for centuries and Dorcan is no different. He genuinely cares for the dead and their families. He loves the quiet and peacefulness of his inherited profession. He is a devout follower of the nature god Lallanis and draws his powers from her. His garden and chapel is lush and well kept, with all manner of flora and fungi. He is always welcoming, although he always keeps a close eye on non-Firbolgs when they're around. The garland of flowers that he wears around his neck at all times is the holy symbol that he uses as his spellcasting focus.
