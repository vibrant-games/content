# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Indomitable
    - content: you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can use this feature 3 times per Long Rest.
  - title: Gunslinger Abilities
  - abilities: 
    - title: Firearm Proficiency
    - content: You gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms.
    - title: Gunsmith
    - content: You gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and 
               intricate firearms are only available through crafting.
               Firearm Properties - Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that 
                                    property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.
               Reload - The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.
               Misfire - Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until 
                         you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be 
                         mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.
               Explosive - Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, 
                           the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.
    - title: Adept Marksman
    - content: You learn to perform powerful Trick Shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms. Trick Shots. You learn two trick shots of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. 
               Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack. You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
               Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.
               Trick Shots
               Bullying Shot - You can use the powerful blast and thundering sound of your firearm to shake the resolve of a creature. You can expend one grit point while making a Charisma (Intimidation) check to gain advantage
                               on the roll.
               Dazing Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to dizzy your opponent. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Constitution saving 
                             throw or suffer disadvantage on attacks until the end of their next turn.
               Deadeye Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to gain advantage on the attack roll.
               Disarming Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to shoot an object from their hands. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a 
                                Strength saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object be pushed 10 feet away from you.
               Forceful Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to trip them up and force them back. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a 
                               Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you.
               Piercing Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to fire through multiple opponents. The initial attack gains a +1 to the firearm’s misfire score. On a hit, 
                               the creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target within your first range increment. Only the initial 
                               attack can misfire.
               Violent Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one or more grit points to enhance the volatility of the attack. For each grit point expended, the attack gains a +2 to the firearm’s 
                              misfire score. If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage die per grit point spent when determining the damage.
               Winging Shot - When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to topple a moving target. On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Strength saving throw 
                              or be knocked prone.

               expended grit points after a short or long rest. Saving Throws. Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects. The saving throw DC 20

    - content: Pact of the Blade - You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. 
                                   This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 
                                   minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by 
                                   performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it 
                                   into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact 
                                   weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the 
                                   extradimensional space when the bond breaks. - Nicodeamus' Pact Weapon are his Firebrand Revolvers.

               rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity,
               for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature,
               no matter the weapon's type.
    - title: Accursed Specter
    - content: You can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears,
               it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack 
               rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife
    - title: Armor of Hexes
    - content: Your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, 
               regardless of its roll
    - title: Master of Hexes
    - content: You can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see 
               within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature

    - title: Pact Weapons - 2x Firebrand Revolvers
    - content: The Firebrand appears much as a normal revolver (See DMG p. 268), but its cylinder is loaded with six empty, brass cartridges.
               The Firebrand magically fills these empty cartridges with ammunition when the trigger is squeezed. As a result, you never need to reload the Firebrand and it does not require ammunition unless you wish to load it 
               with magical ammunition.
               A cartridge manually loaded with a magical bullet but no powder does not magically generate any powder when the pistol cycles to that cartridge.
               If you have access to modern bullets, you can load them into the Firebrand as into a normal revolver.
               You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the Firebrand. Additionally, you can use a bonus action to attack with the Firebrand on each of your turns, you do not add your Dexterity modifier to the 
               damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.
    - title: Ring of Evasion
    - content: This ring has 3 Charges, and it regains 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your Reaction to expend 1 of its Charges to succeed on that saving 
               throw instead.

    background-story: |
      Nicodeamus Dumas is the eldest grandson of Anastasia Dumas and the defacto leader of the Dumas Family cult. Pretty much since birth, Nicodeamus was raised by his grandmother Anastasia, and grew in her twisted image.
      As a child, his only friends were the lesser devils that serve his grandmothers patrons. They taught him their ways, their magic, their bargains, their deceptions, and they taught him well. He grew to become a consumate
      grifter, conman and liar. They taught him to play their games and to gamble. When he came of age, his grandmother introduced him to her benefactor, to whom he took an oath, brokered a deal and was rewarded with a
      sizeable amount of power upon completion of his given task. At a very early age he also became fascinated with a new technology slowly appearing across the realm, firearms. His doting grandmother encouraged his new hobby
      and acquired him the best pieces that could be found. He mastered handling them, repairing them, shooting them and eventually even building his own. He is one of the formost masters of firearms in existence, and when he
      took on his patron, he was gifted a pair of very special revolvers. He used his gifted weapons to carry out his side of the bargain he made, the murder of his own wayward father and retreive his mother. His father had
      taken his mother away from the family and turned her against their patron. Nicodeamus was charged with hunting him down, ending his life and returning his mother to his grandmother.  He did so with glee and with flourish.
      Gunning the man down in cold blood, almost as an afterthought, after securing his mother and burning their home to the ground. Completing his assigned task, he granted significant power from his patron and has been
      practicing his gifts ever since. As he reached his late 20's, his grandmothers growing frailty required him to step up and take over the day to day leadership of the family. With the help of his wife/sister Irini, he has
      been a very successful leader, growing the family in size, power and influence.

    personality: |
       Nicodeamus Dumas is almost a caricature of a man. Tall and bone-thin with pale, freckled skin and wild curls of flaming red hair that he keeps tucked under a wide brimmed hat. He dresses like a dandy, with fine travelling
       clothes, impeccibly pressed, usually in a purple or burgundy with white gloves. He almost always has a sly, almost quizzical smile plastered across his face and entrancing violet-colored eyes. He is perpetually whistling
       a jaunty little tune but makes no effort to hide the sidearm on each hip under his long black coat, openly demonstrating to all that encounter him that he is always a threat. While coming off as jovial and cartoonish,
       Nicodeamus is sharp as a tack and thoroughly vicious. His happy demeanor is primarily for the purposes of recruitment, but also partially because he's a little on the mad side. He is endearing and charming while things
       are going his way, but like a true sociopath, can turn hard and cold at a moments notice. He is ruthless in persuit of his goals, but generally finds it easier to use the carrot rather than the stick to achieve his
       aims. He likes to use either gambling or card tricks to break the ice with potential recruits and can be very persuasive when he wants to be. With the exception of his patron and his granmother, he will tolerate absolutley
       no disrespect or disobedience from the other members of 'The Family' and will not hesitate to sacrifice anyone who invokes his ire.
