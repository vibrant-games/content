    background-story: |
      Once a shining beacon of light and justice, Nothuriel stuck a deal with dark gods to bring her betrayed love back from the dead. Her lover was returned to her as a lich, driving her mad and causing her to embrace the darkness and do the bidding of the dark gods forever. Now she leads legions of the damned and undead against the light.
