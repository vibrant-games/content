# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Ulther Hapwath was originally a human but has spent most of their adult life experimaneting on and augmenting his own body in search of some distorted view of human perfection. A skilled spell slinger and hunter, 
      they hunt and capture many specimens of various creatures to study and experiment on. They are a brilliant biologist with an exceptional knowledge of many different creatures anatomy and the steady hands of a 
      surgeon. Recruited by Gerhardt Klippstein to join the Collegium for their vast biological knowledge, their employers are slightly less than keen on the reckless abandon with which they are willing to experiment 
      on themselves. Since they joined the Collegium, they have been contacted by a mysterious benefactor from beyond the veil. Ulther has no idea who this benefactor is, but they have been helping to guild their 
      self-evolution and in the creation of a substance called Cytoplast, a sort of ooze that helps with the bonding of upgrades and grants temporary healing when applied to a living creature.  Ulther's benefactor is 
      in fact, the disembodied spirit Momir Vig, disgraced and deceased former Guildmaster of the Simic Combine on the Plane of Ravnica. Somehow Momir has crossed into this world and is slowly using Ulther to create 
      Cytoplast and use it to build him a new body.

    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Ulther Hapwath is tall and muscular and severe-looking with pale blue skin and long. hip length, silver/white hair. They wears dark glasses as their replaced eyes are somewhat sensative to bright lights, and a 
      long, black leather trenchcoat that cover most of their bodily features. On closer inspection, its clear that Ulther has made significant modification to their body. Barbed skin on their hands and feet like a 
      spider for climbing, the wings of a manta for gliding, sections of crab-like shell armoring portions of their body and a segmented scorpions tail with stinger are all faintly noticeable if someone spends enough 
      time looking at them, although they are often using some kind of glamour (disguise self, polymorph, etc.) when in public so as not to stand out as much. Ulther is fanatical about his work and about chasing his 
      personal concept of bodily perfection and finds it hard to comprehend why everyone isn't seeking to augment thier bodies. They are reckless and never think twice about experimenting on themselves and have little 
      regard for the wellbeing of the other creatures that they experiment on. Thanks to the influence of their secret benefactor, they have gradually started to explore the commonly unknown arcane study of biomancy. 
      While mostly keeping this information to themselves, they have shared some of their studies with their close friend and fellow body-modifying scientist and Collegium member Thadeus Periwinkle.
