    background-story: |
      <p>Foreatha is a Wood Elf of around 400 years old. She has devoted the better part of her life to serving the stars and the Gods of Nature and learning the healing arts.  Daily, she comes in from the nearest forest to open her stall in the market square with fresh herbs to help and heal as many people as she can. She does charge for most of her services as they require time, materials and she does need money to survive, but her prices for herbs, lotions and potions are very reasonable and she has pretty much anything someone looking for that sort of thing can ask for.</p>
