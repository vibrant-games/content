# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Steel Defender
    - content: Your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which
               uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics. In combat, the defender
               shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a 
               bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, 
               not just Dodge. If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 
               feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel 
               defender if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die. Ferdinand's Defender has Wings instead

               Repair - (3/Day). The magical mechanisms inside the defender restore 2d8 + PB hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.
               Reactions -
               Deflect Attack - The defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 5 feet of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the defender.
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Arcane Jolt
    - content: You've learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the 
               strike to create one of the following effects
               The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
               Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.
               You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    background-story: |
      Ferdinand Von Lefthoff knows that flying is the best, safest and fastest way to travel. Having his own wings, he knows this from experience. As such, he has devoted his life to creating reliable commercial air transport. 
      Realizing both the potential for financial gain and the advancement of science and society, Oswald Vardklemp invited Ferdinand to join the Collegium Imginata, offering him the resources to develop his airship. He grew up 
      in the Feywild, but was exiled due to his rabid pusuit of science and technology. Ferdinand has gone through several iterations and designs for airship, but has yet to get a functioning prototype working that is capable 
      of transporting more than a couple people at a time. He firmly believes hes close to a brektrhough though.

    personality: |
      Ferdinand Von Lefthoff is about 7' tall and covered in gray and white feathers, with owl-like features, beak, talons and bright, alert eyes. He is highly eccentric and dresses to match his personality. He dresses in a 
      manner of a vintage British Naval Officer with a scarlet jacket with brass buttons and epilettes, a bicorn admirals hat complete with a peacock like feather and a monocle. He is quite the character, bold, exhuberant, 
      cunning, and anyone can tell that if he ever gets his ship off the ground he will be a daring swashbuckler. In the meantime, he is also a dilligent and careful scientist in the pursuit of his goal.
