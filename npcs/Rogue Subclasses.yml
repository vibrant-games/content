   - - Soulknife Abilities:
       - Psionic Talent: You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of 
                         which is a d6.
                         - Psionic Talent Options: You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways -
                           - Psi-Bolstered Knack: When your non-psionic training fails you, you can tap into your psionic power to help; if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you 
                                                  can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success.
                           - Psychic Whispers: You can use your psychic abilities to establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, you give yourself and at least one
                                               other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal
                                               to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action 
                                               required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can’t use this telepathy if it can’t speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic
                                               connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don’t need to speak a common language to understand each other.
                            - Changing the Die’s Size: If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example,
                                                       if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your 
                                                       Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you 
                                                       roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this 
                                                       class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases - at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
                            - Psi Replenishment: As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long
                                                 rest.
       - Psychic Blades: You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. When you are about to make a melee or ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free 
                         hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals 
                         psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals 
                         damage. After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The 
                         damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.
       - Psionic Enhancement: You can focus your psionic power to give yourself an extraordinary ability. When you finish a long rest, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until you finish a long 
                              rest - 
                              - You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If a creature can speak at least one language, it can respond to you telepathically.
                              - Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.
                              - Your hit point maximum and your current hit points increase by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your rogue level.
       - Soul Blades: Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you finer control over them in the following ways - 
                      Homing Strikes: If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, 
                                      your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size, regardless of the number rolled.
                      Psychic Teleportation: If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can hurl your Psychic Blades to magically transport yourself to another location. As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic
                                             Blades and throw it at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 5 times the highest number on your Psionic Talent die. You then teleport to that space,
                                             the blade vanishes, and your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size.
                      Terrifying Blade: When you damage a creature with your Psychic Blade, you can force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). On a 
                                        failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature isn’t frightened and is immune to your Terrifying Blade for 24 hours.
       - Psionic Veil: You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 10 minutes or until you dismiss this effect 
                       (no action required). This invisibility ends if you deal damage to a creature or if you force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long 
                       rest, unless you decrease your Psionic Talent die by one die size to use this feature again.
       - Rend Mind: You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through a creature’s mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 
                    equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). Unless the save succeeds, the target is stunned until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you 
                    finish a long rest, unless you decrease your Psionic Talent die by one die size to use this feature again

                        others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.
       - Sudden Strike: you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already 
                        used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.

                      creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
       - Infiltration Expertise: you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an 
                                 identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official- looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a 
                                 trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you 
                                 to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.
       - Impostor: you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech,

       - Rakish Audacity: your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need 
                          advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

                  than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart. If you succeed on the check and the
                  creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
       - Elegant Maneuver: you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

       - When a Plan Comes Together: you develop a preternatural knock for planning contingincies and assessing threats. Twice per long rest, you can invoke a flashback where you describe a course of action you previously took 
                                     to prepare for the current scenario, and describe how that preperation affects it now. The course of action you describe must involve a single descreet event, such as bribing a guard or 
                                     packing a mundane item, and cannot describe events that have already been resolved through gameplay. Make all ability checks that would be required to acomplish the proposed action. If those 
                                     rolls succeed, then that preperation was successful.

                                                 spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're 
                                                 replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic. 
       - Mage Hand Legerdemain: when you cast Mage Hand, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it;
                                - You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
                                - You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
                                - You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.
                                You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check. In addition, you
                                can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.
       - Magical Ambush: if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.
       - Versatile Trickster: you gain the ability to distract targets with your Mage Hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you
                              advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
       - Spell Thief: you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster. Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you 
                      can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and
                      you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell
                      slots. The creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
                      
                      
                      
   - - Inquisitive Abilities:
       - Ear for Deciet: you develop a keen ear for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8
       - Eye for Detail: you can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues
       - Insightful Fighting: you gain the ability to decipher an opponent’s tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated,
                              contested by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have
                              disadvantage on it. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target
       - Steady Eye: you gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
       - Unerring Eye: your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you,
                       provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature. You can use this feature a number of times
                       equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
       - Eye for Weakness: you learn to exploit a creature’s weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature
                           increases by 3d6.
