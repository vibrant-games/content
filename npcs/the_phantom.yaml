# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      The Phantom was once a priest named Adrenthis of Yanto. He specialized in hunting and tracking fiends and the undead. Unfortunately for him, he ran afoul of a Banelich, far beyond his ability to combat and was slain. 
      Fortunately for him, the gods of good saw him as a useful tool and returned him to a semblance of life. He bacame a revenant tasked with hunting down the being that killed him. He has run up against the Banelich several
      times, coming up short each time. In his continued quest to destroy his killer, he founded a clandestine organization of sort that he calls The Dead Hunters. In between attempts on the Banelich that haunts him, he and 
      his group have continued on wih his previous calling of ridding the world of fiends and undead abominations. They work out of a small private abbey in the foothills and but are able to travel quickly throughout the 
      continent via both mounts, vehicle or if speed is of the essence, teleportation.

    personality: |
      The Phantom is tall and broad Dragonborn. Decended from an Ancient Crystal Dragon. He sports a layer of crystaline scales over his body and his reptilian head including his frills and crest ropey hair.  His eyes are a 
      cool platinum and clearly filled with wisdom. He wears full gleaming plate armor with shield and jewel covered helmet. He rides into battle on his massive white warhorse Arthon, who is similarly armored to his master. 
      He is extremely dedicated to the path of peace and redemption and the destruction of those who are unredeemable. After his death and ressurection, he no longer felt quite like himself, and exchanged his name for a new 
      one for his new life, The Phantom. He is beyond calm, cool and collected in life and in battle. He inspires his troops with his sheer force of will. He is selfless and willingly puts himself into harm's way to protect 
      his companions and innocents. His is a battle that has been going on for a long long time, roughly 200 years, and hes very tired. He's tired of the chase. He's tired of watching his loved ones grow old and die. He's 
      just tired. But he knows he will not be allowed to move on to his final reward until he destroys the evil that made him this way.
