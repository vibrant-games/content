# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

               throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. 
               It also can't take Reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to Escape from an Effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

               percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the Nature of the intervention; the Effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would be 
               appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, 
               no roll required.

    - title: Circle of Mortality
    - content: You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use 
               the highest number possible for each die. In addition, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, 
               and you can cast it as a bonus action.   
    - title: Eyes of the Grave
    - content: You gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. 
               Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you 
               anything about a creature's capabilities or identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long 
               rest.
    - title: Channel Divinity - Path to the Grave
    - content: You can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until 
               the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the
               curse ends.
    - title: Sentinel at Deaths Door
    - content: You gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any 
               effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long 
               rest.
    - title: Potent Spellcasting
    - content: You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
    - title: Keeper of Souls
    - content: You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you 
               regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
  - title: Paladin Abilities
  - abilities:
    - title: Divine Sense
    - content: Can focus awareness to know the location and type of any celestial, fiend or undead within 200 feet not behind total cover. Can detect any place of object that has been consecrated or desicrated 
               within the same radius. Can use this ability x per long rest

    - title: Fighting Style

    - title: Divine Smite
    - content: when you hit a creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell
               slot, plus 1d8 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an Undead or a fiend.

               If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

             You gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this Magic Weapon. When you hit a fiend or an Undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage. While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in
             a 10-foot radius around you. You and all Creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on Saving Throws against Spells and other magical Effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the Paladin class, the radius of the
             aura increases to 30 feet.
    - title: Angelic Longbow
    - content: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. An angelic bow has 3 charges. When you hit a creature you can expend a charge to deal an additional 1d10 fire, lightning, or radiant damage. 
               The bow regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn. If you hit a fiend or undead with the angelic bow, it deals an additional 1d10 radiant damage
    - title: 10 Sunmote Arrows
    - content: This magical arrow deals an additional 2d6 radiant damage when it hits. The target rolls a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; on a failure, they are blinded until the beginning of your next turn. This arrow 
               disappears when used and reappears in your quiver, or otherwise in your possession if you have no quiver, the next morning at dawn.
    - title: 10 Light Arrows
    - content: Once this arrow is drawn, you can use your bonus action to focus on the arrow, causing it to brightly glow a golden color. Before the start of your next turn, you can shoot this arrow in place of a normal attack. 
               You do not make an attack roll with this arrow. Instead, all creatures in a 5-foot-wide line extending from you to the longest range of your weapon must succeed on a DC 19 saving throw or take 2d10 piercing damage
               and 10d10 radiant damage. If there is only one creature in this line and it is within your weapon's normal range, that creature has disadvantage on this saving throw. If an undead, a fiend, or creature that is 
               vulnerable to radiant damage fails this saving throw, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
    - title: Champion's Lance
    - content: The Champion's Lance resembles a very long lance of oak carved with spirals in such a way that the wood looks to almost have naturally grown this way. Upon attuning with it the lance is nearly weightless in hand. 
               You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
               Long Reach - The champion's lance has an increased reach of 10 feet. But, due to its massive size, you can only attack with this lance once per turn. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target 
                            within 5 feet of you.
               Champion's Flurry - If the attuned wielder of the champion lance has an extra attack feature, they add an additional 1d12 damage to the lance's damage rolls for each number of additional attacks they can make. So,
                          a 5th level fighter can add a 1d12 to the champion lance's damage, whereas an 11th level fighter can add 2d12.
               Single Striker - Once the lance makes a successful attack, the tip breaks off and all subsequent attacks made with the lance are at a disadvantage. The lance regrows its potency after the course of a long rest.  
               Riding Shift - If you successfully hit a creature with the lance while mounted, you may use your bonus action to move on your mount a distance up to half your mount's speed in any direction without provoking 
                              opportunity attacks.

               have one free.

               The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its Contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
    - title: Angelic Plate Mail

               disadvantage on saving throws.
    - title: Helm of Brilliance
    - content: This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from The Helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, The Helm loses its magic.
               You gain the following benefits while wearing it
               You can use an action to cast one of the following Spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component - Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall
               of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from The Helm.
               As long as it has at least one Diamond, The Helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one Undead is within that area. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.
               As long as The Helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to fire damage.
               As long as The Helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a Command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim 
               light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an Attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a 
               Bonus Action to speak the Command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.
               Roll a d20 if you are wearing The Helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, The Helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 
               feet of The Helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in The Helm. The Helm and its gems are then destroyed.

      times, coming up short each time. In his continued quest to destroy his killer, he founded a clandestine organization of sort that he calls The Dead Hunters. In between attempts on the Banelich that haunts him, he and 
      his group have continued on wih his previous calling of ridding the world of fiends and undead abominations. They work out of a small private abbey in the foothills and but are able to travel quickly throughout the 
      continent via both mounts, vehicle or if speed is of the essence, teleportation.

    personality: |
      The Phantom is tall and broad Dragonborn. Decended from an Ancient Crystal Dragon. He sports a layer of crystaline scales over his body and his reptilian head including his frills and crest ropey hair.  His eyes are a 
      cool platinum and clearly filled with wisdom. He wears full gleaming plate armor with shield and jewel covered helmet. He rides into battle on his massive white warhorse Arthon, who is similarly armored to his master. 
      He is extremely dedicated to the path of peace and redemption and the destruction of those who are unredeemable. After his death and ressurection, he no longer felt quite like himself, and exchanged his name for a new 
      one for his new life, The Phantom. He is beyond calm, cool and collected in life and in battle. He inspires his troops with his sheer force of will. He is selfless and willingly puts himself into harm's way to protect 
      his companions and innocents. His is a battle that has been going on for a long long time, roughly 200 years, and hes very tired. He's tired of the chase. He's tired of watching his loved ones grow old and die. He's 
      just tired. But he knows he will not be allowed to move on to his final reward until he destroys the evil that made him this way.
