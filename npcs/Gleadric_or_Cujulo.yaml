# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Gleadric was raised in a Firbolg stronghold in the remote forests of Yyl on the outskirts of known civilization. The pivoting day in his youth, when his shamanic calling took control of his dreams and appended them to his
      woken life, was nearly crippling at first; changing him from the day-to-day gentle tenderer to flora into a seemingly secretive tanner and collector of furs. "You've changed." One of his closest friends imparted, "but...
      change is life." He patted Gleandric on the back while Cujuloa continued stripping a large Bison of it's hide. Gleadric became two spirits inhabiting one physical body. Cujuloa was largely in charge of his daily productive
      activities - invoking dreams in his waking life and providing soft, warm dreams to his peoples - while Gleadric remained in control of his interactions with his community. However, Cujuloa demanded that they take their
      firm beliefs in equality and profound spirituality to the civilized communities and that they find new means and ways to bring peoples back to the basic love of for flora and fauna. They believe that by building room in
      the market for impressive hide and fur trade - a return to more primitive and anarchic ways - while impressing the importance of adhering to dreams over the purported reality of the waking world; that this will bring
      peoples back to their essential being. Their goals, along with their split psyche, make social appearances, well, a challenge in situations relying on a finely detailed social contract. They come across to most as
      wild or 'crazy', but upon closer inspection and interactions, their distilled spirituality leaves a mark of genuine good. Depending on which spirit is taking charge, they refer to themselves in 3rd person - either
      Gleadric or Cujuloa.
