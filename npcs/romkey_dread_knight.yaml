# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

                                   action.
    - title: Rune Weapon
    - content: At 2nd level, you can draw on the dread magic of the grave to inscribe your weapon with deathly Runes. These Runes may be used for additional effects described in this class description. You must spend one hour 
               inscribing your weapon, which may be completed during a short rest. You may inscribe up to two weapons, and you cannot be disarmed of your Rune Weapons while you are conscious. If you inscribe a third weapon, you 
               must choose one of your previous two weapons from which to remove the Runes.
    - content: You have 4 total Runes, and you gain Runes as indicated in the Class Table. You recover all expended Runes when you finish a short or long rest. If an ability that uses a Rune requires a saving throw, the saving 
               throw DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. No Rune features require a spell attack roll.
    - title: Rune Strike
    - content: Beginning at 2nd level, when you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, you may expend a Rune to add an additional effect to the attack, as listed below.
    - content: Rejuvenating Strike - You channel what’s left of your divine blessing into your weapon strike. If your attack hits, you may expend 1 Rune to cause the attack to deal Radiant damage, and heal you for half the 
                                     damage dealt (rounded down). You can only regain HP if the blow is struck in combat. At 5th level, you may add your Constitution modifier to the healing, twice your Constitution modifier at 
                                     11th level, and 3 times your Constitution modifier at 17th level.
    - content: Icy Blast - If your attack hits, the target takes the normal attack damage, and you may expend 1 Rune to deal 1d6 extra Cold damage and force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the 
                           target has its speed halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target does not have its speed reduced. The damage increases by 1d6 at 5th (2d6), 11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level.
    - content: Plague Strike - If your attack hits, the target takes the normal attack damage, and you may expend 1 Rune to deal 1d6 additional Necrotic damage and afflict the target with Plague for 1 minute. At the beginning of
                               its next turn, and at the beginning of each of its turns thereafter, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 Necrotic damage from the plague. On a 
                               successful save, the effect ends. The Plague effect does not stack if applied more than once. The strike and plague damage increases by 1d6 at 5th (2d6), 11th (3d6), and 17th (4d6) level.
    - title: Grim Oath
    - content: At 3rd level you mimic the Oath you took in your former life. Though you can choose to follow the same Tenets, you are not bound by your Paladin Oath any longer, and may do as you please. Choose a 
               Grim Oath that you follow exclusively. You may choose the Oath of the Undying, Oath of the North, or Oath of the Plague, all detailed at the end of this class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd 
               level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th lel.
    - content: Oath of Undying - Undying Presence - At 3rd level when you take this Oath, your blood churns with radiant fire. You gain resistance to Radiant damage. Additionally, the target of your Rejuvenating Strike has 
                                                    disadvantage on attacks against targets other than you until the end of its next turn.
    - content:                   Aura of the Undying - At 7th level, allies within 10 feet of you gain resistance to Radiant damage. Additionally, the power of your radiant blood can help prevent death. You and allies within 10 
                                                       feet of you gain advantage on Death Saving Throws. The power of your will is so strong, the saving throw effect persists even if you are unconscious or incapacitated. At 
                                                       18th level, this Aura increases to 30 feet.
    - content:                   Radiant Blood - Upon reaching 9th level, the radiant fire of life infuses your soul. Your blood becomes radiant fire. If you are cut and bleeding, the radiance of your blood causes no damage, but
                                                 you may use a bonus action to use your blood for lighting a candle, campfire, or another similar use. A fire lit in this manner is considered non-magical and burns a shade of 
                                                 radiant yellow instead of the normal color of fire
    - content:                   Improved Rejuvenating Strike - At 15th level, when you use Rejuvenating Strike, you may spend up to 3 additional Runes. For each additional Rune spent, the healing increases by an amount equal to
                                                                your Constitution modifier.
    - content:                   Purgatory - By 20th level, your radiant vitality allows you to refuse to die. When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, but not killed outright, your soul may keep fighting in your stead. 
                                             Your soul has the same speed, hit points, and ability scores as your body, AC 20, and deals magical slashing damage equal 1d10 + your strength modifier. Your soul cannot take any 
                                             action other than the attack, disengage, dodge, or help action, and cannot use any Rune Strikes. If your Soul is reduced to 0 hit points, or moves more than 100 feet from your body, 
                                             you die immediately and cannot be resurrected by any means. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you succeed on 3 death saving throws, and you must finish a long rest before you 
                                             can benefit from it again. You make your death saving throws at the end of your turn during Purgatory.
    - title: Lingering Radiance
    - content: At 3rd level, the small spark of radiance from your former life manifests. You are immune to disease.
    - title: Extra Attack
    - content: Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - title: Aura of Dread
    - content: At 6th level, your presence hangs heavily on your enemies. Whenever an enemy within 10 feet must make a saving throw, it takes a penalty on the throw equal to 1 + half your Wisdom modifier, rounded down. This Aura
               does not stack with itself or similar effects (such as the Bane spell). At 18th level, this Aura increases to 30 feet.
    - title: Dreadful Visage
    - content: Upon reaching 6th level, your connection to Death allows you to temporarily alter your body slightly. As an action, choose one of the following options. The effect lasts for one hour, or until you use another 
               action to end it.
    - content: Visage of Fear - You may use the power of Death to temporarily twist your face and body into a horrific sight. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
    - content: Visage of Grace - You may use the power of Death to temporarily heal the scars of your previous death, making you more acceptable among those who have not experienced Death. You have advantage on Charisma 
                                (Persuasion) checks.
    - title: Relentless Advance

    personality: |
      Romakey has very little in the way of personality. He is a harsh and cruel master, but his troops being mostly undead and completely in his thrall, don't really seem to mind. Chaos and destruction are the only things he
      cares about. Though she has gone mad and joined in his destruction, he no longer even has affection for his beloved wife Nothuriel
