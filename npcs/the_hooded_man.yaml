# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - content: Maneuvers - You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th 
                           level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one
               Ambush - When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.
               Bait and Switch - When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature
                                 is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) 
                                 gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.
               Brace - When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you're wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature, using
                       that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.
               Commander's Strike - When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly 
                                    creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's 
                                    damage roll.
               Commanding Presence - When you make a Charisma (Intimidation), a Charisma (Performance), or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.
               Disarming Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the 
                                  superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
               Distracting Strike - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's 
                                    damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.
               Evasive Footwork - When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
               Feinting Attack - You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll 
                                 against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
               Goading Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and
                                the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
               Grappling Strike - Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and then try to grapple the target as a bonus action (see the Player's Handbook for
                                  rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check.
               Lunging Attack - When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's 
                                damage roll.
               Maneuvering Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the 
                                    attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks 
                                    from the target of your attack.
               Menacing Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target 
                                 must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
               Parry - When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity 
                       modifier.
               Precision Attack - When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before
                                  any effects of the attack are applied.
               Pushing Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target
                                is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
               Quick Toss - As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add 
                            the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.
               Rally - On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That 
                       creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.
               Riposte - When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die 
                         to the attack's damage roll.
               Sweeping Attack - When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of 
                                 the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of 
                                 the same type dealt by the original attack.
               Tactical Assessment - When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), an Intelligence (History), or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.
               Trip Attack - When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target 
                             is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

    background-story: |
      The Hooded Man is actually the long thought dead patriach of the Dumas Family. Only his former wife Anastasia knows who he is. Saul is only a fraction of the man he once was. He was murdered by backstabbing business 
      partners, an event that sent Anastasia into her downward spiral. But that was all part of the family's patrons plan. In order to protect his investment while she learned to control her newfound powers, the patron returned 
      Anastasia's husband from the dead. Saul returned as a mostly blank slate filled only with lust for revenge and the overwhelming desire to protect his former wife. Even in life, Saul was a hulk of a man, but since his 
      return, infused with the patron's power he has become an absolute beast.

    personality: |
      The Hooded Man is a massive brute of a man. He stands about 7 feet tall with his entire body obscured by his long shadowcloak. He wears full chain mail armor but it doesn't impede his movement of stealth. He rarely shows 
      his pale, discolored skin or the scars that remain from his murder. The Hooded Man doesn't have much of a personality. His return from the dead didn't leave him with much of a brain. He is silent and cannot speak, only 
      moan. He also cannot be reasoned or bargained with. Anastasia and her patron's control over him is absolute and he only does what they tell him to. He will do everything in his power to protect Anastasia, and his rage in 
      doing so is palpable. He is single mined in his service and will kill anyone or anything he is instructed to.
