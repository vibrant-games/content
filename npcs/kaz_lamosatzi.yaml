    background-story: |
      <p>In the town of Barrelheist [Seaside town or city] people are always astir because of the constant influx of supply and trade ships and the endless queue of traders and merchants hoping to be the first to acquire exotic goods. When the diaspora of hill Gnomes of Aznmott [Distant and Disappeared Gnomish City] were driven from their home by a string of massive experiments gone awry, they arrived to settle among the hills and valleys surrounding Barrelheist. These gnomes were instinctively drawn to the tradeport and quickly began to make up a large proportion of the population. Among this growing frontier shanty marketplace grew a remarkably talented gnome who shows great promise with steam technology, Kaz Lamosatzi.</p><p>Kaz' family was unorthodox in all possible ways. They rarely had a stable home and instead would simply have meeting spaces where they would reconvene after hard-working days of scavenging for materials to develop their steam inventions. What's more, the family unit was not traditional and instead consisted of non-hierarchical extended family and friends. Family structure is so diffuse among these Hill Gnomes that it's rare a member can identify a proper 'mother' or 'father'. Instead they are most drawn to whatever individual inspires invention!</p><p>Kaz cultivated his capacity for invention and steam technology and his gadgets gained popularity among the sailors and merchants of Barrelheist. Always chipper and looking for the good in things, Kaz successfully disguises a certain disdain for wealthy people that he acquired living much like an urchin in a shanty town frequented by the noble and affluent.
