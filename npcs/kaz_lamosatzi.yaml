# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      In the town of Barrelheist [Seaside town or city] people are always astir because of the constant influx of supply and trade ships and the endless queue of traders and merchants hoping to be the first to acquire exotic
      goods. When the diaspora of hill Gnomes of Aznmott [Distant and Disappeared Gnomish City] were driven from their home by a string of massive experiments gone awry, they arrived to settle among the hills and valleys
      surrounding Barrelheist. These gnomes were instinctively drawn to the tradeport and quickly began to make up a large proportion of the population. Among this growing frontier shanty marketplace grew a remarkably talented
      gnome who shows great promise with steam technology, Kaz Lamosatzi. Kaz' family was unorthodox in all possible ways. They rarely had a stable home and instead would simply have meeting spaces where they would
      reconvene after hard-working days of scavenging for materials to develop their steam inventions. What's more, the family unit was not traditional and instead consisted of non-hierarchical extended family and friends.
      Family structure is so diffuse among these Hill Gnomes that it's rare a member can identify a proper 'mother' or 'father'. Instead they are most drawn to whatever individual inspires invention! Kaz cultivated his capacity
      for invention and steam technology and his gadgets gained popularity among the sailors and merchants of Barrelheist. Always chipper and looking for the good in things, Kaz successfully disguises a certain disdain for
      wealthy people that he acquired living much like an urchin in a shanty town frequented by the noble and affluent.

    personality: |
      Kaz is an inquisitive fellow. He likes to travel, and wander from place to place. He's always looking for new oddities and curiousities that he can dissect and learn from. He is a happy fellow and very good natured
