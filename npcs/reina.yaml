# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    # Background story:

    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    background-story: |
      Reina was cursed as a young child, possibly for something her outlander parents did. She was given the Curse of the Forgotten. This has left Reina to raise and fend for herself from a young age. She longs for friends and
      connection while doing what she needs to to survive. She longs to return to the barbarian clan that forgot her as a child but lives on city streets as a pick pocket and thief. What Reina doesn’t know about herself is a
      very dangerous secret for everyone....
      Reina is The Wraith! Her curse is actually a spell put on her by a spymaster of the assassins guild at the same time that he murdered her tribe and created her split personality. When her skills are needed a simple
      subliminal phrase brings out the Wraith, the realms deadliest assassin, and Reina never remembers a thing.

    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Reina is lonely, she craves human contact, and that makes her far to trusting of anyone that can see and especially remember her. She aims to please and will do her best to help anyone who is kind to her. She is a survivor
      and quite capable of getting by on her own. She is very insecure about her appearance and nervously picks at her clothes and hair when she is interacting with other people. She knows nothing about her alter ego, but is
      aware that she occasionally loses time, sometimes days at a time, and this disturbs her greatly. She desperately wish someone could remember her long enough to help her figure out what happens to her.
