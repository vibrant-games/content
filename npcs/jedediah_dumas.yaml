# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    - title: Ring of Spell Turning
    - content: While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the
               spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
    - title: Ring of Mind Sheilding
    - content: While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other Creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your Alignment, or know your Creature Type. Creatures can telepathically 
               communicate with you only if you allow it.
               You can use an action to cause the ring to become Invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.
               If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for The Afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically 
               communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this Telepathic Communication.

    background-story: |
      Jedediah Dumas is the second son of Anastasia and the public face of the family. While his nephew, Nicodeamus, is the leader behind the scenes and Anastasia's favourite, Jedediah is the public face of the the family. 
      He handles all political dealings and negotiations between the family and any outside institution, be they governments, businesses or other organizations. Jedediah sits on the city council as well as the boards 
      and committees of several other institutions including the City Watch. He will always negotiate to the benefit of the family and attempt to influence any organization he is apart of to do his family's work for them. 
      Jedediah has also been charged as the primary caregiver for his beloved sister Delores and dotes on her as often as his other responsibilties allow. He is not happy with the horrors that have been wrought on his dear 
      sister, but he understands that they needed to happen for the good of the family. He is, however, very unhappy with how Nicodeamus abuses and tortures his mother. He, in fact, does not like much of what Nicodeamus does, 
      who he is or the decisions he has made for the family and believes that Anastasia should have put him in charge instead of his demented nephew. While he would never make an outright play for leadership, especially while 
      Anastasia is still alive, he has been building his own power base in case the day should ever come. Above all else, he will do anything in his power to protect Delores.

    #
    personality: |
      Jedediah Dumas is an aging man with a large powerful build. A bear of a man, he is always impeccably dressed in fine clothing and takes pride in his appearance. His graying hair is close-cropped and his short beard is 
      well maintained. He is a severe, no nonsense kind of individual with a unique ability to get his goals accomplished. He is an accomplished and convincing orator and proud of his skill.  He is devoted to his family and 
      escpecially devoted to his beloved, long-suffering sister, Delores. He is bitter and jealous of the favor that his mother Anastasia, has shown to his nephew Nicodeamus, and believes that he is the rightful heir 
      to the leadership of the Dumas clan. He is not bold enough to attempt a coup, but could possibly be persuaded to sneakily aid a plot that would see his nephew brought low or humiliated, as long as it wasn't to the 
      detriment of the family as a whole
