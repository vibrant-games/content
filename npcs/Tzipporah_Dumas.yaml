# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Tzipporah Dumas or Zippy to her friends (she doesn't have any friends), is the only daughter of Basil Dumas. She is the youngest blood member of the Dumas Family and as a result, has grown up without 
      the benefit of much in the way of rules or order. Her cousin Nicodeamus has taken special interest in raising her and has taught her all that he knows of his favorite hobby, Firearms! She's a quick study and has 
      become a mean gunfighter in her own right, she however, doesn't yet have access to the magic that her cousin has. When she comes of age (should she survive that long) she will take the same pact that her cousin 
      took and become the family's next Hexslinger.

    #
    personality: |
      Tzipporah Dumas is a slight, little, slip of a girl with hip-length, dark brown hair and big violet eyes. She is so enamored with her cousin, she has even taken up dressing like him. She is wild and carefree with 
      very little respect for authority, especially that of her "stuffy" father Basil. The only authority figure she seems to respond to at all is Nicodeamus. She is obsessed with her cousin and hopes to one day either 
      replace or join Irini as his wife. Though not the sharpest knife in the drawer, Tzipporah is completely fearless and will have a go at pretty much anyone or anything at anytime.
