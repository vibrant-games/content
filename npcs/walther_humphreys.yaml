# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
      Walther Humphreys is the aged, alcoholic and addle-minded former mayor of the town/city. He is also a oft used pawn of the Dumas Family.  Back while he was still the mayor, Basil Dumas infected Walther with his 
      Lycanthrope in order to gain control over him. The mayor's dirty little secret allowed the Dumas' to get things acomplished that they wouldn't have been able to without his help, including installing Jedediah 
      into political offices. In the interceding years, Humphreys has retired from public life and taken up drinking full time, though still gets trotted out from time to time by the Dumas family for political showmanship. 
      He has gone rapidly downhill since his retirement and can often be seen wandering around town drunk and lost. Once a month on the full moon, Walther turns into a wolf and joins Basil Dumas' pack in earnest. He 
      has also been known to change in situations of high stress, but no one has ever survived that long enough to let his secret out, though there has been some rumors. In truth, his lycanthrope is likely the only 
      reason he is still alive.

    #
    personality: |
      Walther Humphreys is a wisened old man. Hunched over with a cane, gray hair and scruffy beard. He dresses in what were once fine nobles clothing, but his years of failing sanity and hard drinking have left them 
      filthy and shabby at best. Walther is and alcoholic and while once he was a respected politician, he is now mostly a local punchline. A combination of his alcoholism, his age and his circumstances have left him 
      with extnded bouts of dementia and often wanders aimlessly around town talking nonsense and looking for help. His Lycanthropy turns him into a vicious bloodthirsty monster, but his dementia means that unless 
      directly in the company of Basil Dumas, he doesn't really remember his affliction.
