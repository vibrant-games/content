# Vibrant Games NPC file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: |
     A well-traveled adventurer, guide and line-slinger, Nahkirin knows the canyons and mountains of Zendikar like the back of her hand. Like most Zendikari who lived through the Eldrazi war, she has been to hell and back and
     has the scars to prove it. Having lost so much and so many, she is reluctant to let anyone new into her life. Between her adventuring and the war, she has found many passes through places that few have ever found their way
     through and marked the trails in her clan colors. She is an expert guide and always happy to get out of Seagate into the wilderness, even if it means guiding strangers to their destination. Before the war, she was a
     follower of the goddess Kamsa and a member of her order, but the likeness of her goddess now bares to much of a resemblance to the Eldrazi Titans for her to have any faith left. She has abandoned her order but still
     maintains the skills she has learned and has translated them into her daily life as a guide and adventurer

    #
    # Personality (or something like that):
    # Expand on the introduction, appearance, expressions, mannerisms, etc.
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    personality: |
      Nahkirin lives a life of adventure. She much prefers the wildness of the wilderness to the confines of civilization. The more adventure the better, whatever it takes to keep her mind off of everything shes been through.
      She is exceptionally skilled at climbing and the traditional Kor skill of Line-Slinging, is very proud of her skill and will not hesitate to brag about her prowess. She is generally not keen on people and will avoid making
      attachments as much as possible. She has lost faith in her order. She does her best to hide it, but she is definitely haunted by the things she saw and did during the war
