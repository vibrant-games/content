    background-story: |
      Merrick comes from a long line of tanners and leather workers. The skills have been passed down through generations of his family along with the leather working magic his great great grandfather developed.  He works hard and loves his work. He takes great pride in the quality and beauty of his work. He lovingly trains his twin boys in the family trade. Not only is he an immaculate craftsman, he is also a shrewd businessman. He knows the quality of his work and will not be swayed on his prices. His prices aren't unreasonable, but they are definitely not on the cheaper end
