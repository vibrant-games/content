# Vibrant Games Faction file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: As a Cleric and Paladin in the service of lawful good dieties, Adrenthis of Yanto specialized in hunting and tracking fiends and the undead. Unfortunately for him, he ran afoul of a Banelich, far beyond
                      his ability to combat and was slain. His gods saw fit to bring him back as a revenant to continue his good works, at the same time hugely augmenting his power levels, and with the mandate to assemble a group
                      of like-minded individuals to carry on their crusade against fiends and the undead. In order to keep his identity a secret, Adrenthis abondoned his former life and took on the mantle of The Phantom. The 
                      Phantom began to seek out individuals with special talents that could and would be willing to help realize his new organization's purpose. Recruiting the likes of Sister Mariah Quartz, Uha Bannock and Peace
                      Fist; The Dead Hunters have become a force to be reckoned. Backed by the deep pockets of several religious organizations, they have been working hard to carry out their mandate

    # No length limit for now.
    #
    modus operandi: The Dead Hunters operate as a covert martial unit for several different religious organizations, yet maintain their own agenda and leadership structure that is autonomous from any of their sponsoring groups.
                    Most of their hunting is done through intensive research, scouting and investigation, resulting in pin point strikes agains their targets. However, they are also often on hand to deal with situations that 
                    have arisen with litte to no time to prepare, wading into the tides of undead and fiendish bodies, striking them down with great relish and fervor. Each member of the group has their own distinct reasons for
                    fighting this fight, but they are all very good at what they do, and very devoted to the cause. They do their best to remain an urban legend, but sometimes that is just unavoidable, but they always try to get
                    in and out of situations as quickly and unseen as possible.
