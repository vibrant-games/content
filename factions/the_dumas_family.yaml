# Vibrant Games Faction file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    secrets:   The Family's Matriach Anastasia is over 200 years old, her lifespan being extended by her relationship with the family's patron Devil. There is also extensive infighting for power among the blood members of the family    
    
  profile:

    #
    # Background story:
    # The long form description of who and what the faction are.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    background-story: Many years ago, after the murder of her wealthy husband, Anastasia made a deal with a powerful devil for the power to seek revenge on her husbands killers. This deal gave her immense power in return for 
                      sending souls to the devil to feast upon. The deal has greatly extended Anastasia's life span, but has not stopped her from aging. In the service of her devil master, she has built the cult known as the 
                      "Dumas Family", some of which are actual blood relatives and descendants, but most of which are cultists , followers and hangers-on. Her cultists cultivate the follwers and the best of them get innitiated 
                      into the family and the rest become sacrifices to their patron. The Family has developed an evergrowing following and because of Anastasia's power, keen mind and ruthlessness has made deep inroads into many
                      local institutions including guilds, noble houses, city hall, the city watch and possibly even further. Anastasia has, in recent years, passed the leadership of the Family to her oldest and favorite 
                      grandson Nickodeamus, a cocky and vicious litlle cur, and his wife Irini. However, she still performs most of the communion and sacrificial rites to her patron herself. Anastasia's decission to skip a 
                      generation in the leadership has created a scism in the family. Infuriating her children especially Jedediah and Basil who both belives that they are the rightful heir. Unfortunately for them, they were
                      born before the family pact was sealed and because of that, Anastasia never fully trusts them. Despite this jealousy, both men are far too frightened of their mother to publicly question her decision and 
                      as such, continue to do her bidding. The family works as a whole to further the ascension of their patron Devil, although what that means is unclear to anyone other than Anastasia and possibly her daughter
                      Delores.

    # Modus Operandi: An indepth description of of how the faction operates in the world, why the do what they do and how they do it
    # Expand on 
    # without any length limits.
    #
    # Required.
    # No length limit for now.
    #
    modus operandi: The Dumas Family mostly operates as a cult, recruiting and indoctrinating new members in order to occupy strategic positions in governemnt, and other halls of power, or to act as fodder and sacrifices for 
                    their dark rituals. Nickodeamus and his wife Irini are the most public faces of the family and responsible for most of their recruiting and indoctrination efforts among the general population. However, 
                    Anastasia's sons Jedediah, Basil and Mordechai handle most of the more clandestine recruitment of high level officials, often via blackmail or other nefarious means. Delores, daughter of Anastasia and mother 
                    of both Nickodeamus and his wife Irini, is completely mad, but operates as an oracle of sorts for the family, and many of their actions are fulfilments of her prophetic visions. as muddled and unclear as they 
                    are.
