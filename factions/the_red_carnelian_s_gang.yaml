# Vibrant Games Faction file format.
#
# For long fields, we should be able to embed <html-tag>...</html-tag>s,
# if everyone is cool with that approach.  OR we could use markdown instead.
#
# HTML requires more discipline -- we need to come up with a CSS stylesheet,
# and stick to using the styles defined in our stylesheet.  Markdown is
# simpler, because we can convert and automagically apply the stylesheet.
#
# Long fields are of the form:
#
#     field: |
#       TEMPLATE
#       MORE TEMPLATE
#
# For example, with HTML tags:
#
#     field: |
#       <p> Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.
#       He likes to beat up kobolds. </p>
#       <p class="small"> Kobolds deserve it, anyway. </p>
#       <p> Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor
#       and a very long shopping list that contains many
#       items, some very few of which include: </p>
#       <ul>
#       <li> toilet paper </li>
#       <li> broccoli </li>
#       </ul>
#
# Or with Markdown:
#
#     field: |
#       Gorbonzonger the goblin is a very bad goblin.  He likes to beat up kobolds.
#       Kobolds deserve it, anyway.
#       Gorbonzonger has an amulet made of camphor and a very long shopping list that contains many items, some very few of which include:
#       - toilet paper
#       - broccoli
#
# (There might be other formatting systems worth considering, too!)
#

#
# Currently there is no schema for this template.
# It will take some time to create a validating schema, so that,
# for example, many fields are optional, but some fields are
# required; enumerated fields are only allowed to have certain
# values; and so on.
#
# Once the validating schema is created (probably using
# Open API syntax, unless anyone has any preferences), we'll
# be able to validate submissions and accept / reject if we choose.
#
# Also the validating file format is the ONLY place we do
# content validation.  The database and user interface remain
# agnostic to the validation rules (although the submission
# UI will be set up to make it easy to e.g. pull down enumerated
# values).  This allows us to change the schema in ONE PLACE
# ONLY, not have to modify multiple components (UI, database,
# future mobile apps, etc).  The file format validator is
# the arbiter of what's allowed and what isn't.

    background-story: | 
     Widowed Actress Maria Estivan had long been a patron and benefactor of some of the local orphanges, having grown up as an orphan herself. Her new Wife, Argath had always loved children even though she could never have any 
     of her own. As their relationship grew and love blossomed, the pair came up with a plan to continue supporting orphans and regrowing Argath's coven.  From this plan, The Carnelian Shroud and The Carnelian's Gang were born. 
     Maria became The Shroud and began leading a band of ruffians, robbing the rich dressed as a feared highwayman, and Argath became Nanny, running their orphanges, training children to succeed in life, join the gang, or for a 
     very select few, to become her new coven. Nanny and Maria eventually got married and pledged their lives to each other and to their ever-growing number of children. Their plan has been a great success, the gang continues to
     grow, and Nanny continues to pour her heart and soul into raising the children right and protecting her wife on the roads, to the best of her abilities.

    modus operandi: |
     The Carnelian's Gang is very much the underground face of a very legitimate network of orphanges. Very few members of the gang actually know that the tribute they pay to the gang from their jobs goes to support the orphanages
     , some might be happy to know it, some might use it to their advantage. which is why it's a secret kept from the vast majority of them. Better to just let the rank and file believe that they're just out for themselves. The 
     Shroud handles running most of the day-to-day operations of the gang, plannning jobs, organizing the troops and collecting the spoils, though she rarely goes out on the jobs herself anymore. Nanny, for her part, manages
     the day-to-day operations of the orphanages, runnning the staff, raising the children and taking care of daily maintenance. She also uses her powers to help plan jobs as well as "cleaning up" unfortunate messes that come
     with running a secret criminal enterprise
