## Directories
Directory structure is as follows:

### npcs
NPC YAML files to go here.

### images
Artwork for the NPCs etc.

### templates
For the template NPC, showing how to lay out an NPC YAML file, and template images for artwork, to show dimensions for NPC art, and so on.

---

## Branches
Branch structure is as follows:

### sandbox
For unfinished NPCs and artwork, works in progress, collaborating on NPCs, and so on.

### main
NPCs to be reviewed before pushing to production.

(Eventually we'll probably need more branches for submission-related stuff, but this will do for now.)

### production
What the world sees, the live NPCs and so on.
